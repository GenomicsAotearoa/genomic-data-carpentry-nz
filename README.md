# Genomic Data Carpentry (Aotearoa edition)

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This workshop will serve as a prerequisate to all other GA genomics workshops
It is intended for beginners who are about to start or have just started doing genomics for their project. This will likely be honours, masters or PhD students.

It will take a few lessons from the carpentries genomic carpentry workshop, but will also provide a uniquely NZ approach, with information on how to work with NZ sequencing facilities and NZ data.

The aim is to get learners familiar with genomic terminology and data types, as well as how to think about think about planning your experiment and keeping good, computer-ready data records.
