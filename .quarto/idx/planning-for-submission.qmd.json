After you have done your extractions in the lab, you should perform QC with:\n\n1. A spectrophotometer (e.g., NanoDrop, DeNovix), which will give you a good indication of the purity/contamination of your sample through 260/280 and 260/230 ratios. This method is not very reliable for determining concentration of your nucleic acid.\n\n2. A fluorescent-based quantification method (e.g., Qubit), which will give you a very accurate indication of concentration of your nucleic acid (but not of any contaminants).  \n\n3.  A fragment analysis instrument (e.g., Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent 5300 Fragment Analyzer or Agilent TapeStation), which you can think of like a high-tech agarose gel. It will give you a good indication of your 28S/18S ratio for RNA (this is used to determine the overall RIN - RNA integrity number*) or your fragment size distribution for DNA. \n\n\nTogether, these will give you an almost complete picture of your sample, ready for sequencing. Note that if your samples are below threshold quality, there are library prep protocols that can allow for lower quality or degraded samples. Ideally, this should only be done if there is no option to re-extract, re-purify or repeat the experiment. \n\n>*RNA integrity number: note that for some protosome species (e.g., molluscs, arthropods) the [28S rRNA subunit has a hidden break](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55573-1), which can negatively affect the RIN calculation. This results in  the quality of the RNA appearing to be is worse than it actually is.  \n\n\n## Sequencing libraries  \n\nThe first thing that needs to be done for Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing is to turn the DNA or RNA sample into something called a *library*. This converts the raw nucleic acids into a form that the sequencer can actually read. This is generally done by the technician that will also sequence your samples, but some labs may do library prep in-house (i.e., *you* may do it yourself!). For Illumina and PacBio, RNA is first converted into DNA during the library prep process. ONT is a little different, in that it can sequence native RNA directly, with minimal prep before sequencing. DNA library preparation for ONT sequencing is also generally simpler than for Illumina and PacBio. This is because the technology used to sequence the DNA/RNA using ONT is quite different to how Illumina and PacBio achieve it--more on that in the next section on [flow cells and sequencing platforms 101](#flow-cells-and-sequencing-platforms-101)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Illumina lib prep molecular workflow diagram\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-01.png)\n\n:::\n\nLibrary preparation (for Illumina and PacBio) generally involves the following steps, and takes 1-2 days in the lab: \n\n1. **(Optional) Target enrichment / RNA selection**  \nSelectively enriching for your target molecule (e.g., for standard RNAseq you likely will do polyA capture).  \n2. **(RNAseq only)** Converting your RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase.  \n3. **Fragmentation (if needed**)\nSome kits fragment RNA before reverse transcription, others fragment cDNA/DNA after.  \nThis ensures fragments are the right size for the platform (e.g., ~200–400 bp for Illumina).\n\n4. **End repair and A-tailing**  \nEnds are cleaned up so adapters can be ligated efficiently.\n\n5. **Adapter ligation**  \nAdapters are short sequences that enable library binding to the flow cell (Illumina) or capture for SMRTbells (PacBio).  \nSome kits combine this with indexing.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# PacBio lib prep - SMRTbell adapters\n![](figures/pacbio-libprep-01.png)\n\nNote: the SMRTbell technology allows HiFi (high fidelity) long read sequencing. The DNA becomes circularised, which allows the polymerase to make repeated passes around the DNA and the consensus sequence therefore has a higher accuracy than single pass sequencing.\n:::\n\n6. **Indexing (barcoding)**  \nIndices allow multiple samples to be pooled together and sequenced on the same flow cell, then computationally separated afterward (called mulitplexing and demultiplexing).      \n\n7. **Size selection / cleanup**  \nTypically done with magnetic beads to remove adapter dimers and select the desired fragment range.  \n\n8. **Library amplification (if required)**  \nSome protocols use PCR to enrich adapter-ligated molecules; others (e.g., some PacBio) are PCR-free.  \n\n9. **Final QC and quantification**  \nUsing Qubit, Bioanalyzer/Tapestation/Fragment Analyzer, etc. This step ensures your library meets sequencing requirements.  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Bioanalyzer trace of final library (Illumina mRNA lib prep)\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-02.png)\n\n\nWhat do you think the two large narrow peaks are around 15 bp and 1500bp?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# SOLUTION\n\nThe two narrow peaks are ladder sequence. These are internal standards of known size we add in for quality control. These can also be used for concentration estimation, but fluorescence-based quantification (e.g., Qubit) is more accurate.    \n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\nThere are different library prep methods (i.e., protocols) for each platform that you will need to chose. This will depend on a few things, such as:  \n\n- The quality of your RNA/DNA (e.g., high-quality RNA allows polyA selection; degraded samples may require ribo-depletion or specialised kits).    \n- The species/tissue type you extracted your RNA/DNA from (e.g., plants have rRNA types that require plant-specific depletion kits, some tissues have high mitochondrial RNA content).    \n- The type of analysis you want to do i.e., what is your research question  \n\nFor example, if you are doing a 'standard' Illumina RNA sequencing project (e.g,. you plan to do differential gene expression analysis to compare different samples), a  common choice is **Illumina stranded mRNA library prep**, which uses polyA selection to capture mRNA.  However, you may chose **Illumina total RNA library prep** with ribo-depletion, which is more expensive, but it has some advantages such as: it can capture non-polyadenylated RNAs (more comprehensive RNA profile) and and is a better option if your samples are partially degraded (it can also handle FFPE samples).  \n\n#### DISCUSSION 💬\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think polyA capture is used for 'standard' RNAseq?\n\nMature mRNAs have polyA tails, which can be selectively isolated using oligo DT coated beads that bind mature RNAs only. All other non-polyadenylated nucleic acids and cellular debris can then be washed away.\n\n::: \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think we bother adding “index” sequences to libraries at all? Why not sequence each sample separately?\n\nIndexing (barcoding) allows multiple samples to be pooled in a single sequencing run. This massively reduces cost and time. Because each library carries a unique index, they can be mixed (i.e., pooled) together and sequenced simultaneously, and downstream software can computationally separate (demultiplex) them accurately afterward.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think size selection is such an important step? What would happen if we skipped it?\n\nSize selection ensures that fragments fall within the size range the sequencer expects. Without it, you may get:\n\n- leftover adapter dimers (which waste sequencing reads as they take up 'real estate' on the flow cell)  \n\n- too-short fragments (which cluster preferentially, causing over-representation and distorts the data e.g., sequencing may read into adapters or flow cell)    \n- too-long fragments (which may not fully sequence or reduce yield)   \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# How do I know if I have things like adapter dimers in the final library??\n\nThe final fragment analysis (e.g., Bioanalyzer) trace of the library will show you. See below a picture of a trace with adapter dimers present (~120-150bp peak). \n\n*Tip: You can repeat the final wash step in the library prep protocol to remove adapter dimers and re-run Bioanalyzer to confirm. Sometimes a very small peak will still be present which will not overly affect the run (you can see one on the previous image above!)*\n\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-03.png)\nImage from [Illumina general knowledge base](https://knowledge.illumina.com/library-preparation/general/library-preparation-general-reference_material-list/000003874)\n\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\n## Flow cells and sequencing platforms 101\n\nThe three major sequencing platform and consumables companies are Illumina, PacBio (Pacific Biosystems) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Each make different platforms/instruments that can handle different levels of throughput, but the chemistry and the 'reading' of the sequencing is the main point of difference between the three companies.\n\nA few examples of the different platforms are:\n\n**Illumina**  \n\n- MiSeq i100\n- NextSeq 550 / 1000 / 2000\n- NovaSeq 6000 / X \n\n**PacBio**  \n\n- Sequel II  \n- Revio  \n\n**Oxford Nanopore Technologies**  \n\n- MinION  \n- GridION  \n- PromethION  \n\nA **flow cell** is the physical surface inside the sequencing machine (or platform) where the actual reading of DNA or RNA occurs. There are different sizes you can chose from, depending on how many reads you need. Although Illumina, PacBio, and ONT all call their consumables “flow cells,” the underlying technologies are very different.\n\nFor the most part, and in-depth knowledge of how these flow cells work is not needed to get you started with your sequencing project. \n\nHere are the major differences:\n\n| Feature | Illumina | PacBio (HiFi / SMRT) | Oxford Nanopore (ONT) |\n|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **How sequencing works** | Sequencing-by-synthesis (fluorescent nucleotides added one base at a time) | Single-molecule real-time sequencing (polymerase incorporates fluorescent bases inside ZMWs) | Nanopore sensing (changes in ionic current as DNA/RNA passes through a pore) |\n| **Flow cell structure** | Patterned flow cell with billions of oligos that form clonal clusters | SMRT Cell containing millions of Zero-Mode Waveguides (ZMWs) | Membrane embedded with thousands of protein nanopores |\n| **What binds to the flow cell** | Libraries bind via adapters to oligos → amplified into clusters | A single SMRTbell + polymerase complex loads into each ZMW | DNA or RNA strand with a motor protein threads into a nanopore |\n| **Signal detected** | Fluorescent signal imaged each cycle | Fluorescent flashes when each base is incorporated | Changes in electrical current across the pore |\n| **Amplification?** | Yes — cluster generation required | No — true single-molecule reads | No (PCR-free), though can use PCR in library prep |\n| **Typical read length** | 100–300 bp | 10–25 kb HiFi reads | 10 kb to >100 kb (ultra-long >1 Mb possible) |\n| **Can sequence native RNA?** | No — convert to cDNA library | No — convert to cDNA library | Yes — direct RNA sequencing |\n| **Strengths** | High accuracy, high throughput, cost-efficient, chemistry highly compatible with different species/tissues | Highly accurate long reads; excellent for haplotype resolution | Ultra-long reads; portable; real-time analysis; can detect base mods |\n| **Limitations** | Short reads only | Lower throughput than Illumina; expensive | Higher raw error rate; pore lifetime limits yield and susceptible to clogging |\n| **Best used for** | Standard RNA-seq (DGE); de novo transcriptomes; high-depth short-read assays; metagenomics; error-correcting long reads | Genome assembly (chromosome-level with HiFi); full-length RNA (Iso-Seq for isoforms); structural variant detection | Field-based sequencing (e.g, rapid microbial identification); genome assembly; native RNA including modification detection (e.g., methylation) |\n\n\n\n## Decision points 🤔\n\nChoosing a platform to do your sequencing comes down to the question you are trying to answer. See the last row in the table above 'Best use for' for some examples of why you might pick one platform over another!  \n\nWhen you get in contact with a sequencing facility, the question they will ask you is not *how many samples are you sequencing*, but rather, *how many reads do you need?* This will determine what size flow cell you need, and to some extent, which platform you will use, as different platforms have different capacity (e.g,. Illumina NextSeq is a 'medium throughput' platform, NovaSeq is a 'large throughput' platform). The number of reads you need scale with the size of the genome and/or complexity of your transcriptome. \n\n***As a general rule of thumb,*** for ***transcriptome sequencing*** you will need:\n\n**Table 1:** Reads per sample  \n\n| Purpose / Type | Approx reads per sample | \n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Gene expression profiling            | 5–25 million          | \n| Complete expression + alternative splicing | 30–60+ million   | \n| *De novo* transcriptome assembly       | ~100+ million         | \n\n\\\n\nThe next thing the sequencing facility will ask you if you are doing short-read sequencing (Illumina) is do you want *single-end* or *paired-end* reads. This refers to whether you want a single read (read 1), sequenced from only one end of the library molecule (fragment), or if you want two reads per library molecule (read 1 and read 2, antisense and sense strands). Paired-end costs more, but gives you more resolution.\n\nThere are ***pros*** and ***cons*** to choosing either chemistry:\n\n**Table 2:** Single-end vs paired-end chemistry (short-read Illumina sequencing)   \n\n| Chemistry | Pros | Cons |\n|-----|---------|---------|\n| **Single-end (SE)** | Lower cost, fewer reads required (may be able to do more samples); sufficient for basic gene-level DGE | Limited splice/isoform resolution; less confident mapping when mapping to a genome |\n| **Paired-end (PE)** | Better alignment; improved splice junction and isoform detection; more robust for complex transcriptomes or *de novo* transcriptome assembly | Higher cost; ~2× sequencing required (two reads per fragment) |\n\n\\\n\nLastly, if you are doing short-read sequencing (i.e., Illumina), the sequencing facility will ask you *what read length you want*. You can typically chose from between 50bp-300bp (platform-dependent). The choice between a lower or higher read length will be a balance of cost (higher read length = higher cost) and the level of information you need (complex, novel or *de novo* transcriptomes require higher read lengths; more straight forward analyses with well-annotated genomes can utilise lower read lengths). In contrast, for long-read sequencing platforms (ONT and PacBio), you do not specify a fixed read length. Instead, reads are generated as single, continuous sequences, and their length is determined by the size of the input molecules, the library preparation method, and the sequencing chemistry.\n\nChoosing a ***read length*** is a ***trade-off between cost, and the amount of information*** you will recover:\n\n**Table 3:** Read length (short-read Illumina sequencing) \n\n| Read length | Pros | Cons |\n|-----|----------|----------|\n| **50 bp** | Lowest cost; highest sample multiplexing; sufficient for basic gene-level DGE in well-annotated genomes | Poor isoform and splice junction resolution; higher multi-mapping |\n| **100 bp** | Good balance of cost and information; reliable splice junction detection; widely used for standard RNA-seq | Slightly lower throughput than 50 bp; may miss very complex isoforms |\n| **150 bp** | Improved isoform resolution; better mapping across repetitive regions; useful for novel transcript discovery | Higher cost; fewer reads per run |\n| **300 bp** | Maximum per-read information; helpful for *de novo* transcriptome assembly | Rarely necessary for Illumina RNA-seq; expensive; reduced throughput |\n\n\\\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n\n# EXERCISE #1 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (15 mins)\n***Example RNAseq scenario:*** \n\nYou are working on a mouse model of cancer genomics. You want to do differential gene expression analysis to compare tumour samples to non-cancerous control tissue, to see if you can find genes that are up or down regulated in the cancerous tissue. You have 40 RNA samples, and since your species has a high-quality reference genome and annotation (i.e., mouse: Mus musculus), you know you have a \"good\" genome assembly and annotations to map your sequencing data back to (more on \"good\" genomes later!). The mouse genome is ~2.7 Gb (= 2,700,000,000 bp), diploid, with ~20,000 protein-coding genes.\n\nYou are particularly interested in alternative splicing and novel splice junctions, as you suspect that cancer-associated genes are often regulated at the isoform level. \n\nYou will sequence your samples at the Otago Genomics Facility, and see on [their website](https://www.otago.ac.nz/genomics) they have an Illumina MiSeq and an Illumina NextSeq 2000. Use this [Illumina benchtop sequencing platforms comparison](https://sapac.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms.html) guide to help you decide. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Which platform will you chose?\n\nThe Illumina NextSeq 2000 is a 'medium' sized short read sequencing platform, ideal for standard RNAseq, and is well-suited to this project. It can output up to 540Gb.  \n\nThe Illumina MiSeq is a 'small' sized short read sequencing platform, better suited to QC or amplicon sequencing, and can output up to 30Gb. It is too small for this project.  \n\n\n\n:::\n\n \nNext you need to decide how many reads you need. \n\nBased on table 1 above, how many reads do you need per sample?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Reads per sample choice:\n\nYou decide you need 30 million reads per sample. You pick the lower end of the scale, as you suspect the genes you are most interested in will be highly expressed, and don't expect your tissue to have a particular high transcript diversity that would require more reads. \n\nYou work out what minimum output you need from the flow cell:   \n30 mil reads * 40 samples = 1200 million reads (1.2B).\n\n::: \n\n\nNow you need to decide if you want paired-end or single-end reads.\n\nBased on table 2 above, what would you pick?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Paired-end vs single end choice:\n\nPaired-end sequencing will give better detection of novel isoforms and splice junctions.\n\nThis doubles the number of reads generated per fragment and will give you better resolution.\n\n:::\n\nYou now need to decide which read length you need. Given the mouse genome is well-annotated, but you are looking for potentially novel isoforms, which read length would you pick, based on table 3?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Read length choice:\n\n50 bp would be a good choice for a well-annotated genome like mouse for standard RNAseq, but does not suit this experiment, as you are looking for novel isoforms/alternative splicing.\n\n100bp is probably the best choice, balancing cost with novel isoform discovery. \n\nYou could also chose 150bp, if you want to be sure you'd capture novel isoforms, especially if they are quite long or complex genes - and don't mind a higher cost.\n\n:::\n\nYou are now ready to pick your flow cell. Check out the [Illumina NextSeq2000 flow cell specifications](https://sapac.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/nextseq-1000-2000/specifications.html) and chose which flow cell will suit this project best. There are four flow cells in ascending output size you can choose from: P1, P2, P3 and P4. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Which flow cell will you pick?\n\nChoices from earlier:  \n\n- Total reads needed for your experiment: 1.2 billion reads.  \n- Paired end sequencing using 100bp read length (i.e., 2 x 100bp)  \n\n\nCalculation: 1.2 billion reads x 100 (bp) x 2 (PE) = **240 Gb output is needed** (i.e., 240 gigabase pairs, or 240 billion individual DNA bases sequenced).  \n\nFlow cell options:  \n\n- P1 → No 100bp option and way too low  \n- P2 → 80 Gb  (too low for 1.2B demand)  \n- **P3 → 240 Gb (fits 1.2B reads requirement exactly - best choice!)**  \n- P4 → 360 Gb (oversized for this project)  \n\nNote: the maximum output stated for the flow cell is under optimal conditions, so the P3 flow cell choice just fits, but it is possible you will have less reads then anticipated (e.g., instead of 30 mil reads per sample, you may 28 mil per sample). \n\n:::\n\nCongratulations!

A fluorescent-based quantification method (e.g., Qubit), which will give you a very accurate indication of concentration of your nucleic acid (but not of any contaminants).  \n\n3.  A fragment analysis instrument (e.g., Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent 5300 Fragment Analyzer or Agilent TapeStation), which you can think of like a high-tech agarose gel. It will give you a good indication of your 28S/18S ratio for RNA (this is used to determine the overall RIN - RNA integrity number*) or your fragment size distribution for DNA. \n\n\nTogether, these will give you an almost complete picture of your sample, ready for sequencing. Note that if your samples are below threshold quality, there are library prep protocols that can allow for lower quality or degraded samples. Ideally, this should only be done if there is no option to re-extract, re-purify or repeat the experiment. \n\n>*RNA integrity number: note that for some protosome species (e.g., molluscs, arthropods) the [28S rRNA subunit has a hidden break](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55573-1), which can negatively affect the RIN calculation. This results in  the quality of the RNA appearing to be is worse than it actually is.  \n\n\n## Sequencing libraries  \n\nThe first thing that needs to be done for Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing is to turn the DNA or RNA sample into something called a *library*. This converts the raw nucleic acids into a form that the sequencer can actually read. This is generally done by the technician that will also sequence your samples, but some labs may do library prep in-house (i.e., *you* may do it yourself!). For Illumina and PacBio, RNA is first converted into DNA during the library prep process. ONT is a little different, in that it can sequence native RNA directly, with minimal prep before sequencing. DNA library preparation for ONT sequencing is also generally simpler than for Illumina and PacBio. This is because the technology used to sequence the DNA/RNA using ONT is quite different to how Illumina and PacBio achieve it--more on that in the next section on [flow cells and sequencing platforms 101](#flow-cells-and-sequencing-platforms-101)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Illumina lib prep molecular workflow diagram\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-01.png)\n\n:::\n\nLibrary preparation (for Illumina and PacBio) generally involves the following steps, and takes 1-2 days in the lab: \n\n1. **(Optional) Target enrichment / RNA selection**  \nSelectively enriching for your target molecule (e.g., for standard RNAseq you likely will do polyA capture).  \n2. **(RNAseq only)** Converting your RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase.  \n3. **Fragmentation (if needed**)\nSome kits fragment RNA before reverse transcription, others fragment cDNA/DNA after.  \nThis ensures fragments are the right size for the platform (e.g., ~200–400 bp for Illumina).\n\n4. **End repair and A-tailing**  \nEnds are cleaned up so adapters can be ligated efficiently.\n\n5. **Adapter ligation**  \nAdapters are short sequences that enable library binding to the flow cell (Illumina) or capture for SMRTbells (PacBio).  \nSome kits combine this with indexing.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# PacBio lib prep - SMRTbell adapters\n![](figures/pacbio-libprep-01.png)\n\nNote: the SMRTbell technology allows HiFi (high fidelity) long read sequencing. The DNA becomes circularised, which allows the polymerase to make repeated passes around the DNA and the consensus sequence therefore has a higher accuracy than single pass sequencing.\n:::\n\n6. **Indexing (barcoding)**  \nIndices allow multiple samples to be pooled together and sequenced on the same flow cell, then computationally separated afterward (called mulitplexing and demultiplexing).      \n\n7. **Size selection / cleanup**  \nTypically done with magnetic beads to remove adapter dimers and select the desired fragment range.  \n\n8. **Library amplification (if required)**  \nSome protocols use PCR to enrich adapter-ligated molecules; others (e.g., some PacBio) are PCR-free.  \n\n9. **Final QC and quantification**  \nUsing Qubit, Bioanalyzer/Tapestation/Fragment Analyzer, etc. This step ensures your library meets sequencing requirements.  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Bioanalyzer trace of final library (Illumina mRNA lib prep)\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-02.png)\n\n\nWhat do you think the two large narrow peaks are around 15 bp and 1500bp?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# SOLUTION\n\nThe two narrow peaks are ladder sequence. These are internal standards of known size we add in for quality control. These can also be used for concentration estimation, but fluorescence-based quantification (e.g., Qubit) is more accurate.    \n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\nThere are different library prep methods (i.e., protocols) for each platform that you will need to chose. This will depend on a few things, such as:  \n\n- The quality of your RNA/DNA (e.g., high-quality RNA allows polyA selection; degraded samples may require ribo-depletion or specialised kits).    \n- The species/tissue type you extracted your RNA/DNA from (e.g., plants have rRNA types that require plant-specific depletion kits, some tissues have high mitochondrial RNA content).    \n- The type of analysis you want to do i.e., what is your research question  \n\nFor example, if you are doing a 'standard' Illumina RNA sequencing project (e.g,. you plan to do differential gene expression analysis to compare different samples), a  common choice is **Illumina stranded mRNA library prep**, which uses polyA selection to capture mRNA.  However, you may chose **Illumina total RNA library prep** with ribo-depletion, which is more expensive, but it has some advantages such as: it can capture non-polyadenylated RNAs (more comprehensive RNA profile) and and is a better option if your samples are partially degraded (it can also handle FFPE samples).  \n\n#### DISCUSSION 💬\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think polyA capture is used for 'standard' RNAseq?\n\nMature mRNAs have polyA tails, which can be selectively isolated using oligo DT coated beads that bind mature RNAs only. All other non-polyadenylated nucleic acids and cellular debris can then be washed away.\n\n::: \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think we bother adding “index” sequences to libraries at all? Why not sequence each sample separately?\n\nIndexing (barcoding) allows multiple samples to be pooled in a single sequencing run. This massively reduces cost and time. Because each library carries a unique index, they can be mixed (i.e., pooled) together and sequenced simultaneously, and downstream software can computationally separate (demultiplex) them accurately afterward.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# Why do you think size selection is such an important step? What would happen if we skipped it?\n\nSize selection ensures that fragments fall within the size range the sequencer expects. Without it, you may get:\n\n- leftover adapter dimers (which waste sequencing reads as they take up 'real estate' on the flow cell)  \n\n- too-short fragments (which cluster preferentially, causing over-representation and distorts the data e.g., sequencing may read into adapters or flow cell)    \n- too-long fragments (which may not fully sequence or reduce yield)   \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# How do I know if I have things like adapter dimers in the final library??\n\nThe final fragment analysis (e.g., Bioanalyzer) trace of the library will show you. See below a picture of a trace with adapter dimers present (~120-150bp peak). \n\n*Tip: You can repeat the final wash step in the library prep protocol to remove adapter dimers and re-run Bioanalyzer to confirm. Sometimes a very small peak will still be present which will not overly affect the run (you can see one on the previous image above!)*\n\n![](figures/illumina-libprep-03.png)\nImage from [Illumina general knowledge base](https://knowledge.illumina.com/library-preparation/general/library-preparation-general-reference_material-list/000003874)\n\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\n## Flow cells and sequencing platforms 101\n\nThe three major sequencing platform and consumables companies are Illumina, PacBio (Pacific Biosystems) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Each make different platforms/instruments that can handle different levels of throughput, but the chemistry and the 'reading' of the sequencing is the main point of difference between the three companies.\n\nA few examples of the different platforms are:\n\n**Illumina**  \n\n- MiSeq i100\n- NextSeq 550 / 1000 / 2000\n- NovaSeq 6000 / X \n\n**PacBio**  \n\n- Sequel II  \n- Revio  \n\n**Oxford Nanopore Technologies**  \n\n- MinION  \n- GridION  \n- PromethION  \n\nA **flow cell** is the physical surface inside the sequencing machine (or platform) where the actual reading of DNA or RNA occurs. There are different sizes you can chose from, depending on how many reads you need. Although Illumina, PacBio, and ONT all call their consumables “flow cells,” the underlying technologies are very different.\n\nFor the most part, and in-depth knowledge of how these flow cells work is not needed to get you started with your sequencing project. \n\nHere are the major differences:\n\n| Feature | Illumina | PacBio (HiFi / SMRT) | Oxford Nanopore (ONT) |\n|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **How sequencing works** | Sequencing-by-synthesis (fluorescent nucleotides added one base at a time) | Single-molecule real-time sequencing (polymerase incorporates fluorescent bases inside ZMWs) | Nanopore sensing (changes in ionic current as DNA/RNA passes through a pore) |\n| **Flow cell structure** | Patterned flow cell with billions of oligos that form clonal clusters | SMRT Cell containing millions of Zero-Mode Waveguides (ZMWs) | Membrane embedded with thousands of protein nanopores |\n| **What binds to the flow cell** | Libraries bind via adapters to oligos → amplified into clusters | A single SMRTbell + polymerase complex loads into each ZMW | DNA or RNA strand with a motor protein threads into a nanopore |\n| **Signal detected** | Fluorescent signal imaged each cycle | Fluorescent flashes when each base is incorporated | Changes in electrical current across the pore |\n| **Amplification?** | Yes — cluster generation required | No — true single-molecule reads | No (PCR-free), though can use PCR in library prep |\n| **Typical read length** | 100–300 bp | 10–25 kb HiFi reads | 10 kb to >100 kb (ultra-long >1 Mb possible) |\n| **Can sequence native RNA?** | No — convert to cDNA library | No — convert to cDNA library | Yes — direct RNA sequencing |\n| **Strengths** | High accuracy, high throughput, cost-efficient, chemistry highly compatible with different species/tissues | Highly accurate long reads; excellent for haplotype resolution | Ultra-long reads; portable; real-time analysis; can detect base mods |\n| **Limitations** | Short reads only | Lower throughput than Illumina; expensive | Higher raw error rate; pore lifetime limits yield and susceptible to clogging |\n| **Best used for** | Standard RNA-seq (DGE); de novo transcriptomes; high-depth short-read assays; metagenomics; error-correcting long reads | Genome assembly (chromosome-level with HiFi); full-length RNA (Iso-Seq for isoforms); structural variant detection | Field-based sequencing (e.g, rapid microbial identification); genome assembly; native RNA including modification detection (e.g., methylation) |\n\n\n\n## Decision points 🤔\n\nChoosing a platform to do your sequencing comes down to the question you are trying to answer. See the last row in the table above 'Best use for' for some examples of why you might pick one platform over another!  \n\nWhen you get in contact with a sequencing facility, the question they will ask you is not *how many samples are you sequencing*, but rather, *how many reads do you need?* This will determine what size flow cell you need, and to some extent, which platform you will use, as different platforms have different capacity (e.g,. Illumina NextSeq is a 'medium throughput' platform, NovaSeq is a 'large throughput' platform). The number of reads you need scale with the size of the genome and/or complexity of your transcriptome. \n\n***As a general rule of thumb,*** for ***transcriptome sequencing*** you will need:\n\n**Table 1:** Reads per sample  \n\n| Purpose / Type | Approx reads per sample | \n|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Gene expression profiling            | 5–25 million          | \n| Complete expression + alternative splicing | 30–60+ million   | \n| *De novo* transcriptome assembly       | ~100+ million         | \n\n\\\n\nThe next thing the sequencing facility will ask you if you are doing short-read sequencing (Illumina) is do you want *single-end* or *paired-end* reads. This refers to whether you want a single read (read 1), sequenced from only one end of the library molecule (fragment), or if you want two reads per library molecule (read 1 and read 2, antisense and sense strands). Paired-end costs more, but gives you more resolution.\n\nThere are ***pros*** and ***cons*** to choosing either chemistry:\n\n**Table 2:** Single-end vs paired-end chemistry (short-read Illumina sequencing)   \n\n| Chemistry | Pros | Cons |\n|-----|---------|---------|\n| **Single-end (SE)** | Lower cost, fewer reads required (may be able to do more samples); sufficient for basic gene-level DGE | Limited splice/isoform resolution; less confident mapping when mapping to a genome |\n| **Paired-end (PE)** | Better alignment; improved splice junction and isoform detection; more robust for complex transcriptomes or *de novo* transcriptome assembly | Higher cost; ~2× sequencing required (two reads per fragment) |\n\n\\\n\nLastly, if you are doing short-read sequencing (i.e., Illumina), the sequencing facility will ask you *what read length you want*. You can typically chose from between 50bp-300bp (platform-dependent). The choice between a lower or higher read length will be a balance of cost (higher read length = higher cost) and the level of information you need (complex, novel or *de novo* transcriptomes require higher read lengths; more straight forward analyses with well-annotated genomes can utilise lower read lengths). In contrast, for long-read sequencing platforms (ONT and PacBio), you do not specify a fixed read length. Instead, reads are generated as single, continuous sequences, and their length is determined by the size of the input molecules, the library preparation method, and the sequencing chemistry.\n\nChoosing a ***read length*** is a ***trade-off between cost, and the amount of information*** you will recover:\n\n**Table 3:** Read length (short-read Illumina sequencing) \n\n| Read length | Pros | Cons |\n|-----|----------|----------|\n| **50 bp** | Lowest cost; highest sample multiplexing; sufficient for basic gene-level DGE in well-annotated genomes | Poor isoform and splice junction resolution; higher multi-mapping |\n| **100 bp** | Good balance of cost and information; reliable splice junction detection; widely used for standard RNA-seq | Slightly lower throughput than 50 bp; may miss very complex isoforms |\n| **150 bp** | Improved isoform resolution; better mapping across repetitive regions; useful for novel transcript discovery | Higher cost; fewer reads per run |\n| **300 bp** | Maximum per-read information; helpful for *de novo* transcriptome assembly | Rarely necessary for Illumina RNA-seq; expensive; reduced throughput |\n\n\\\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n\n# EXERCISE #1 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (15 mins)\n***Example RNAseq scenario:*** \n\nYou are working on a mouse model of cancer genomics. You want to do differential gene expression analysis to compare tumour samples to non-cancerous control tissue, to see if you can find genes that are up or down regulated in the cancerous tissue. You have 40 RNA samples, and since your species has a high-quality reference genome and annotation (i.e., mouse: Mus musculus), you know you have a \"good\" genome assembly and annotations to map your sequencing data back to (more on \"good\" genomes later!). The mouse genome is ~2.7 Gb (= 2,700,000,000 bp), diploid, with ~20,000 protein-coding genes.\n\nYou are particularly interested in alternative splicing and novel splice junctions, as you suspect that cancer-associated genes are often regulated at the isoform level. \n\nYou will sequence your samples at the Otago Genomics Facility, and see on [their website](https://www.otago.ac.nz/genomics) they have an Illumina MiSeq and an Illumina NextSeq 2000. Use this [Illumina benchtop sequencing platforms comparison](https://sapac.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms.html) guide to help you decide. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Which platform will you chose?\n\nThe Illumina NextSeq 2000 is a 'medium' sized short read sequencing platform, ideal for standard RNAseq, and is well-suited to this project. It can output up to 540Gb.  \n\nThe Illumina MiSeq is a 'small' sized short read sequencing platform, better suited to QC or amplicon sequencing, and can output up to 30Gb. It is too small for this project.  \n\n\n\n:::\n\n \nNext you need to decide how many reads you need. \n\nBased on table 1 above, how many reads do you need per sample?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Reads per sample choice:\n\nYou decide you need 30 million reads per sample. You pick the lower end of the scale, as you suspect the genes you are most interested in will be highly expressed, and don't expect your tissue to have a particular high transcript diversity that would require more reads. \n\nYou work out what minimum output you need from the flow cell:   \n30 mil reads * 40 samples = 1200 million reads (1.2B).\n\n::: \n\n\nNow you need to decide if you want paired-end or single-end reads.\n\nBased on table 2 above, what would you pick?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Paired-end vs single end choice:\n\nPaired-end sequencing will give better detection of novel isoforms and splice junctions.\n\nThis doubles the number of reads generated per fragment and will give you better resolution.\n\n:::\n\nYou now need to decide which read length you need. Given the mouse genome is well-annotated, but you are looking for potentially novel isoforms, which read length would you pick, based on table 3?\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Read length choice:\n\n50 bp would be a good choice for a well-annotated genome like mouse for standard RNAseq, but does not suit this experiment, as you are looking for novel isoforms/alternative splicing.\n\n100bp is probably the best choice, balancing cost with novel isoform discovery. \n\nYou could also chose 150bp, if you want to be sure you'd capture novel isoforms, especially if they are quite long or complex genes - and don't mind a higher cost.\n\n:::\n\nYou are now ready to pick your flow cell. Check out the [Illumina NextSeq2000 flow cell specifications](https://sapac.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/nextseq-1000-2000/specifications.html) and chose which flow cell will suit this project best. There are four flow cells in ascending output size you can choose from: P1, P2, P3 and P4. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# Which flow cell will you pick?\n\nChoices from earlier:  \n\n- Total reads needed for your experiment: 1.2 billion reads.  \n- Paired end sequencing using 100bp read length (i.e., 2 x 100bp)  \n\n\nCalculation: 1.2 billion reads x 100 (bp) x 2 (PE) = **240 Gb output is needed** (i.e., 240 gigabase pairs, or 240 billion individual DNA bases sequenced).  \n\nFlow cell options:  \n\n- P1 → No 100bp option and way too low  \n- P2 → 80 Gb  (too low for 1.2B demand)  \n- **P3 → 240 Gb (fits 1.2B reads requirement exactly - best choice!)**  \n- P4 → 360 Gb (oversized for this project)  \n\nNote: the maximum output stated for the flow cell is under optimal conditions, so the P3 flow cell choice just fits, but it is possible you will have less reads then anticipated (e.g., instead of 30 mil reads per sample, you may 28 mil per sample). \n\n:::\n\nCongratulations!
