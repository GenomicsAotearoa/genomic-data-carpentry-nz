Whatever you're doing---whether it's transcriptomics, genome assembly, variant calling, metagenomics, or something else---if you will be using genomic data this workshop is for you! \n\n## Prerequisites\nLearners are expected to have a basic (undergraduate) level understanding of biological and genetic concepts, but no familiarity with genomics or bioinformatic/computational skill is required.\n\n## What's covered in this workshop\n\n- Ethical data collection from a New Zealand perspective\n- Organisation---from messy lab books and excel spreadsheets to tidy, computer-friendly data  \n- Working with sequencing facilities and understanding genomic data types  \n- Data storage repositories and public services and facilities  \n- Quality control, wrangling of raw reads and an introduction to genomic terminology  \n\n## What's NOT covered in this workshop\n\n- Basic descriptions of biological and genetic concepts.  \n- Traditional sequencing and services (e.g., Sanger sequencing, qPCR, genotyping, probe-based applications such as microarrays and NanoString nCounter).  \n- Genomic analysis workflows. We have multiple dedicated workshops for genomic pipelines; see [our portfolio here](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html).    \n- Using shell or other bioinformatic tools. See our workshops on [Introduction to shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-shell-for-bioinformatics) and [Introduction to R](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#intermediate-r-for-bioinformatics) to get you started on this. \n- Understanding the cluster, HPC resourcing and specialised software (e.g., we do not cover schedulers such as SLURM, partitions/CPUs/GPUs, choosing compute allocation allowance). See our workshop on [Introduction to Bash Scripting and HPC Job Scheduler](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-bash-scripting-and-hpc-job-scheduler) for this.  \n\n## Glossary\n\n| Term  | Definition |\n|----|--------------|\n| Adapter  | Short synthetic DNA sequence ligated to the DNA molecule during library prep which allows the molecule to bind to the flow cell during sequencing and also provides a primer binding site |\n| bp   | Base pair |\n| DGE   | Differential Gene Expression (analysis) |\n| HCS   | High Capacity Storage |\n| HPC   | High Performance Computing |\n| HiFi   | High fidelity (PacBio) |\n| Index | Also known as a barcode.
