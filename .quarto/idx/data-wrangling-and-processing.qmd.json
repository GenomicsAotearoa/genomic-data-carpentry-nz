Now what?\n\n## Command-line interface (CLI) vs graphical user interface (GUI)\n\nCommand line interface (CLI) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer's operating system. They have different pros and cons. Most people are familiar with the GUI (i.e., point and click) as it is the default interface for most software, particularly on Windows and Mac OS. When using the GUI, you see and interact with visual representations of files, folders, applications, and most other functions of your computer. When using the CLI, you work largely with text representations of software, files, folders, input and output. The shell is a program that allows you to control your computer by typing instructions on the CLI with a keyboard.\n\nThere are several reasons to learn how to use the CLI:\n\n- For most bioinformatics tools, there are no graphical interfaces. **If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics, you're going to need to use the CLI/ shell.**  \n- The shell gives you power and allows you to work more efficiently. Tasks that are repetitive (e.g. renaming hundreds of files) can be automated. Tasks that are tedious (e.g. testing a range of input parameters) can be simplified.  \n- To use remote computers or cloud computing, you often need to use the shell.\n\nHere we will show you a quick introduction to using the shell to quality check your raw reads. For more on the shell, see our workshops on [Introduction to Shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-shell-for-bioinformatics) and \n[Intermediate Shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#intermediate-shell-for-bioinformatics). \n\n>Note: you'll hear the terms 'shell', 'bash', 'unix', 'terminal' and 'command-line' used almost interchangeably. For beginners, you can think of them as essentially all the same thing! As you gain more computational skills, you can dig into the differences.    \n\n## First, check that the data are not corrupt\n\nBelieve it or not, computers can make mistakes! When your data files are being copied over from the sequencing facility to cloud storage, errors can occur that cause your files to become corrupted. This is not always obvious based on file size or a quick look at the contents. The first thing you'll want to do is run a checksum, which will output a fixed-length message of 16 bytes-- a unique identifier of each file. The files should also come with the checksums run by the technician at the sequencing facility. Check out the section on [Data Integrity in our GA shell workshop](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/shell-for-bioinformatics/2_download_data/) for more information on how to run this. \n\n\n## Understanding genomic file types\n\nThe files you will get back from the sequencing facility will most likely end in `.fastq.gz`\n\nThe `.gz` indicates it is a compressed gzip file. For most genomic analyses, you do not need to unzip these first--this saves you storage space, as unzipped files can be double or triple the zipped size!\n\nThe `fastq` indicates the file is in [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format). FASTQ files are a text-based format that stores the raw read sequences, along with a quality score for each base.\n\nThe first 4 lines of a fastq file describe one sequence read:\n\n![](figures/fastq-reads.png)\n\nThe **first line is the header information**, beginning always with an `@`{style=\"color:black\"}.\nThis is the instrument-specific, run identifier and read identifiying information.  \n\n- `V350304715`{style=\"color:black\"} = instrument-specific  \n- `L3`{style=\"color:black\"} = lane 3 on the flow cell. Can be used for troubleshooting if something globally went wrong with sequencing.  \n- `C001`{style=\"color:black\"} = cluster identifier (can be used for troubleshooting, same as above).  \n- `R001`{style=\"color:black\"} = Read 1. All the reads in this file are read 1. If you have paired-end data, you'll have a corresponding read 2 file.  \n- `00020454`{style=\"color:black\"} = unique identifier for that read. \n- `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} = indicates this is a pair member. Only paired-end data have the `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} or `/2`{style=\"color:black\"} additional identifier.  \n\nEach instrument and chemistry will have slightly different header information. The main thing to look out for are indications of the data being read 1 or read 2 (indicates antisense or sense strand data, for protocols that can differentiate strandedness) and whether it is part of a mate pair (indicated by the `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} or `/2`{style=\"color:black\"})\n\nThe **second line is the actual sequence**. Count the number of bases --which read length was chosen for this dataset?\n\nThe **third line is just a \"+\"**. This can be optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.\n\nThe **fourth line is the quality score**. Each base in line 2 has a corresponding quality score, indicated by an ASCII character in line 4. \n\nFrom left to right, these are the quality scores in increasing order of quality:\n\n```\n!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\n```\n\nSo, if a single base has a quality score of `!`{style=\"color:black\"}, which corresponds to a Q-score of 0, this indicates exceptionally poor quality. The sequencing machine was not able to resolve which base it should be. Often these will be shown as N's. \n\nConversely, if a single base has a quality score of `I`{style=\"color:black\"}, which corresponds to a Q-score of 40, this indicates very high quality. The sequencing machine was \"very confident\" that the base called is correct (Q40 indicates an error probabilty of 0.0001, i.e., a 1 in 10,000 chance of the base being called wrong, on average. `I`{style=\"color:black\"} is near the upper end of typically achieved quality values, but higher is possible. \n\nFor more on quality scores, you can also read this [Illumina guide here](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/files-used-by-basespace/quality-scores). Note there are different types of encoding, but you will most frequently encounter [Phred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score)+33.\n\nWe can assess the quality score across all reads using software called [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and trim down reads to remove poorer quality bases below a set threshold (generally with newer sequence data, you can use Q30 or Q40 as a cut-off). We won't cover trimming here, see our workshop on [RNA-seq Data Analysis](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#rna-seq-data-analysis) for a step-by-step guide. \n\n\n\n### Other genomic file types \n\nWe've talked about `fastq` and `gz` files types, but there are some other common genomic file types you should know about.\n\nYou should also be aware that the extension on the file type is largely there just so you as a human know what kind of file it is. When using the CLI, the computer does not care what the extension says. \n\n| Extension | Name                    | Description                                                                 |\n|----------:|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `.fasta` or `.fa`, `.fna`, `.faa`    | FASTA, FASTA nucleic acid, FASTA amino acid | Contains sequence data.

Most HPC services (e.g., REANNZ) come with this program (and many other commonly used programs) pre-installed, so you likely will not need to install it anywhere. \n\nFastQC will give you a good overview of the quality of the reads (i.e., how confidently each base was called by the sequencing platform) and a few other statistics about the reads.  Each statistic will be assigned a PASS, WARNING or FAIL:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-pass.png){width=\"8%\"}  PASS   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ![](figures/fastqc-warn.png){width=\"8%\"}  WARNING  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ![](figures/fastqc-fail.png){width=\"8%\"}  FAIL  \n\n\nThe following examples come from the '[Good Illumina Data](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc.html)' and '[Bad Illumina Data](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/bad_sequence_fastqc.html)' reports from the [Babraham Bioinformatics website](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/index.html).  \n\n### EXAMPLES: Good vs bad sequence data \n\nBelow are the summarised pass, warning, fail statistics for the good (left) and bad (right) data. \n![](figures/fastqc-good-bad-summary.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\nHere we will choose a few of these as examples to delve into:\n\n#### Per base sequence quality\nThe **per base sequence quality** is the first plot you can use to assess the quality. You can picture the reads as being all stacked on top of each other, and the average quality at each position (x-axis) shown as a boxplot (i.e., position 1 shows a boxplot of the quality scores of base pair #1 in all reads, position 2 shows a boxplot for base pair #2, and so on).\n\nThe quality score is shown on the y-axis. A score of below Q20 (error probabilty = 0.01, or 1 in 100 bases are incorrect on average) is shown as red - boxplots that extend in to this section indicate positions in the read that are poor quality.  \n\nIn general, when you are trimming your reads you should pick a quality cut off of at least Q30 (error probabilty = 0.001; 1 in 1000), and some researchers even use Q40 (error probabilty = 0.0001; 1 in 10,000) for newer data. If you are working with older data (10+ years old, sequenced before ~2014), you may need to pick Q20 as a cut-off. These plots help you decide what is best for your data. \n\nAfter trimming reads, you should run FastQC again to compare how the average quality has changed and see how many reads are retained after trimming.  \n\n**Good data:** Per base sequence quality\n![](figures/fastqc-good-01.png)\n\nIn this 'Bad data' below, we can see most reads are dropping in to the Q20 and below range from about base position 24 onwards to position 40. This is a typical pattern, where sequence quality tends to drop off around the 3' end for Illumina reads.  \n\n**Bad data:** Per base sequence quality\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-01.png)\n\n\n#### Per sequence quality scores\n\nThe **per sequence quality scores** plots the Q-score per sequence, rather than per base position as above. The average Q-score for the whole read is taken, then plotted to show how many reads have that average score. Below we can see that for the good data and bad data, almost all reads sit above Q30. \n\n\n**Good data:** Per sequence quality scores\n![](figures/fastqc-good-02.png)\n\nFor the bad data, we can see that the larger peak of reads sits at a slightly lower (and wider) Q score, and there is a second peak at a very poor score of around Q17. These data show us that there may be a large proportion of reads with a high Q-score retained after trimming (good news!). The data has been given a 'pass' by FastQC, indicating it has not dropped below the threshold for this category to be given a warning or fail.  \n\n\n**Bad data:** Per sequence quality scores\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-02.png)\n\n\n\n#### Overrepresented sequences\n\nMultiple sources can cause overrepresented sequences in your dataset. It can be a true biological or experimental effect, for example if you expect a few genes to be exceptionally highly expressed or if you have done targeted amplicon sequencing. However, it often reflects an issue that may have happened during extraction or library prep. Contaminating rRNA is a common culprit in RNAseq, as rRNA exists at a much higher concentration than other mRNAs in the cell. You may have to make a judgement call whether your data is still useable if it is highly contaminated. While contaminating reads can be filtered out, you'll have less useable reads. PCR overamplification during the library prep can also be an issue - in which case it may be possible to repeat part of the library prep with less PCR cycles.\n\nFor our good data, no overrepresented sequences were detected:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-good-03.png)\n\nHere is a snippet of our bad data, showing a 'warning' with multiple overrepresented sequences detected, and the count and percentage of the total reads is also shown:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-03.png)\n\nFastQC looks for hits that are matches in a database of common contaminants. No hit was detected for any of these sequences, but it is worth BLASTing some of the highest count sequences to find the culprit.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n# EXERCISE 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (1 min)\n\nWhat percentage of reads would need to be overrepresented for this category to be given a fail?  \n\nUse the [FastQC help guide here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/).\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# SOLUTION\n\nIf any sequence is found to represent more than 1% of the total it will get a fail. \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Good genome, bad genome?\n\nYou will often hear geneticists refer (somewhat colloquially) to *“good”* and *“bad”* genome assemblies. But what does this actually mean? And how can you tell whether a species you are working on has a good genome assembly?\n\nIn practice, we assess genome assemblies using a few metrics that capture **contiguity** and **completeness**.\n\n***Common genome assembly metrics***\n\n- **Contiguity** is often measured as contig and scaffold N50, which is the length cutoff for the longest contigs that contain 50% of the total genome length. In this era of long-read genome assemblies, a contig N50 over 1 Mb is generally considered good. [Excerpt taken from PacBio article.](https://www.pacb.com/blog/beyond-contiguity/)\n\n  Also see [Wiki entry on N50/L50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N50,_L50,_and_related_statistics).  \n\n- **Completeness** is often measured using a BUSCO (**B**enchmarking **U**niversal **S**ingle-**C**opy **O**rthologs) score, which measures completeness using sets of conserved, single-copy genes expected to be present in most species within a specified lineage. \n\nReported as percentages of complete, duplicated, fragmented, and missing genes. <- change to example. \n\nGenome assemblies can be described more qualitatively as (in order of less to more complete):\n\n  - **Contig-level** – sequences are assembled but not ordered or oriented. Often can be thousands to hundreds of thousands of contigs.  \n  - **Scaffold-level** – contigs linked together, often with gaps. None are placed (i.e., chromosome known) or localised (i.e., orientation on chromosome known).   \n  - **Chromosome-level** – one or more chromosomes complete, but some unplaced scaffolds may be present.  \n  - **Complete genome** - all chromosomes are resolved with no gaps. Not necessarily telomere-to-telomere (T2T).\n\n  See [NCBI Glossary for Assembly level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/glossary/).\n\n\\\n\n***What do we mean by a “good” genome?***\n\nA *good* genome assembly is typically one that is:\n\n- **Highly contiguous**  \n  Reads have been assembled into long sequences called *contigs*, ideally approaching full chromosome lengths.\n\n- **Biologically complete**  \n  Most expected genes are present (high BUSCO completeness).\n\n- **Structurally accurate**  \n  Large-scale errors such as mis-joins or collapsed repeats are minimised.\n\n\\\n\n***Assembly quality vs annotation quality***\n\nIt is important to distinguish between:\n\n**Genome assembly** i.e., the reconstructed DNA sequence itself, and the **Genome annotation**, which is the identification and labelling of genomic features, including gene structures (exons, introns, and CDS), non-coding RNAs (e.g., rRNA, tRNA and lncRNA), and associated identifiers such as gene_id, transcript_id, and database cross-references.\n\n\nA genome can be **well assembled but poorly annotated**, or vice versa.\n\n\n### EXERCISES 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (6 mins):\n\n***How would you describe these genomes?*** \n\nLook at the assembly stats and make some notes of how 'good' you think each assembly is.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n# EXERCISE #1 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (3 mins) - Human Genome Assembly\n[Human Genome assembly GRCh38.p14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.40/)\n\n![](figures/genome-assembly-human-01.png)\nNote: RefSeq is the curated database.

How did they assess this and what conclusion did they make about the eumetazoan ancestor resemblance to modern vertebrates, sea anemones and protosomes?

They found many major genes, such as Hox genes, retained the same intron/exon structure in sea anemones as vertebrates, but this was not retained in model protosome species. Based on this they conlcuded that sea anemone genomes more closely resemble vertebrates than protosome species (fly, nematode, annelid) do. While the genome assembly itself is quite fragmented, the annotations are quite good, indicating that any conclusions the authors made comparing genomes and a gene stucture level are likely quite robust, but it would not be feasible with this assembly to make any conclusions based on larger genomic structure (i.e., at closer to chromosome level).   \n\n:::\n\n::: \n\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\n\n# Workshop complete :) ","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Genomic data wrangling and processing\n\nYour data is now on a server/cloud/compute system/local computer, ready for analysis.

Most HPC services (e.g., REANNZ) come with this program (and many other commonly used programs) pre-installed, so you likely will not need to install it anywhere. \n\nFastQC will give you a good overview of the quality of the reads (i.e., how confidently each base was called by the sequencing platform) and a few other statistics about the reads.  Each statistic will be assigned a PASS, WARNING or FAIL:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-pass.png){width=\"8%\"}  PASS   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ![](figures/fastqc-warn.png){width=\"8%\"}  WARNING  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ![](figures/fastqc-fail.png){width=\"8%\"}  FAIL  \n\n\nThe following examples come from the '[Good Illumina Data](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/good_sequence_short_fastqc.html)' and '[Bad Illumina Data](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/bad_sequence_fastqc.html)' reports from the [Babraham Bioinformatics website](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/index.html).  \n\n### EXAMPLES: Good vs bad sequence data \n\nBelow are the summarised pass, warning, fail statistics for the good (left) and bad (right) data. \n![](figures/fastqc-good-bad-summary.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\nHere we will choose a few of these as examples to delve into:\n\n#### Per base sequence quality\nThe **per base sequence quality** is the first plot you can use to assess the quality. You can picture the reads as being all stacked on top of each other, and the average quality at each position (x-axis) shown as a boxplot (i.e., position 1 shows a boxplot of the quality scores of base pair #1 in all reads, position 2 shows a boxplot for base pair #2, and so on).\n\nThe quality score is shown on the y-axis. A score of below Q20 (error probabilty = 0.01, or 1 in 100 bases are incorrect on average) is shown as red - boxplots that extend in to this section indicate positions in the read that are poor quality.  \n\nIn general, when you are trimming your reads you should pick a quality cut off of at least Q30 (error probabilty = 0.001; 1 in 1000), and some researchers even use Q40 (error probabilty = 0.0001; 1 in 10,000) for newer data. If you are working with older data (10+ years old, sequenced before ~2014), you may need to pick Q20 as a cut-off. These plots help you decide what is best for your data. \n\nAfter trimming reads, you should run FastQC again to compare how the average quality has changed and see how many reads are retained after trimming.  \n\n**Good data:** Per base sequence quality\n![](figures/fastqc-good-01.png)\n\nIn this 'Bad data' below, we can see most reads are dropping in to the Q20 and below range from about base position 24 onwards to position 40. This is a typical pattern, where sequence quality tends to drop off around the 3' end for Illumina reads.  \n\n**Bad data:** Per base sequence quality\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-01.png)\n\n\n#### Per sequence quality scores\n\nThe **per sequence quality scores** plots the Q-score per sequence, rather than per base position as above. The average Q-score for the whole read is taken, then plotted to show how many reads have that average score. Below we can see that for the good data and bad data, almost all reads sit above Q30. \n\n\n**Good data:** Per sequence quality scores\n![](figures/fastqc-good-02.png)\n\nFor the bad data, we can see that the larger peak of reads sits at a slightly lower (and wider) Q score, and there is a second peak at a very poor score of around Q17. These data show us that there may be a large proportion of reads with a high Q-score retained after trimming (good news!). The data has been given a 'pass' by FastQC, indicating it has not dropped below the threshold for this category to be given a warning or fail.  \n\n\n**Bad data:** Per sequence quality scores\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-02.png)\n\n\n\n#### Overrepresented sequences\n\nMultiple sources can cause overrepresented sequences in your dataset. It can be a true biological or experimental effect, for example if you expect a few genes to be exceptionally highly expressed or if you have done targeted amplicon sequencing. However, it often reflects an issue that may have happened during extraction or library prep. Contaminating rRNA is a common culprit in RNAseq, as rRNA exists at a much higher concentration than other mRNAs in the cell. You may have to make a judgement call whether your data is still useable if it is highly contaminated. While contaminating reads can be filtered out, you'll have less useable reads. PCR overamplification during the library prep can also be an issue - in which case it may be possible to repeat part of the library prep with less PCR cycles.\n\nFor our good data, no overrepresented sequences were detected:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-good-03.png)\n\nHere is a snippet of our bad data, showing a 'warning' with multiple overrepresented sequences detected, and the count and percentage of the total reads is also shown:\n\n![](figures/fastqc-bad-03.png)\n\nFastQC looks for hits that are matches in a database of common contaminants. No hit was detected for any of these sequences, but it is worth BLASTing some of the highest count sequences to find the culprit.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n# EXERCISE 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (1 min)\n\nWhat percentage of reads would need to be overrepresented for this category to be given a fail?  \n\nUse the [FastQC help guide here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/).\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n# SOLUTION\n\nIf any sequence is found to represent more than 1% of the total it will get a fail. \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Good genome, bad genome?\n\nYou will often hear geneticists refer (somewhat colloquially) to *“good”* and *“bad”* genome assemblies. But what does this actually mean? And how can you tell whether a species you are working on has a good genome assembly?\n\nIn practice, we assess genome assemblies using a few metrics that capture **contiguity** and **completeness**.\n\n***Common genome assembly metrics***\n\n- **Contiguity** is often measured as contig and scaffold N50, which is the length cutoff for the longest contigs that contain 50% of the total genome length. In this era of long-read genome assemblies, a contig N50 over 1 Mb is generally considered good. [Excerpt taken from PacBio article.](https://www.pacb.com/blog/beyond-contiguity/)\n\n  Also see [Wiki entry on N50/L50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N50,_L50,_and_related_statistics).  \n\n- **Completeness** is often measured using a BUSCO (**B**enchmarking **U**niversal **S**ingle-**C**opy **O**rthologs) score, which measures completeness using sets of conserved, single-copy genes expected to be present in most species within a specified lineage. \n\nReported as percentages of complete, duplicated, fragmented, and missing genes. <- change to example. \n\nGenome assemblies can be described more qualitatively as (in order of less to more complete):\n\n  - **Contig-level** – sequences are assembled but not ordered or oriented. Often can be thousands to hundreds of thousands of contigs.  \n  - **Scaffold-level** – contigs linked together, often with gaps. None are placed (i.e., chromosome known) or localised (i.e., orientation on chromosome known).   \n  - **Chromosome-level** – one or more chromosomes complete, but some unplaced scaffolds may be present.  \n  - **Complete genome** - all chromosomes are resolved with no gaps. Not necessarily telomere-to-telomere (T2T).\n\n  See [NCBI Glossary for Assembly level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/glossary/).\n\n\\\n\n***What do we mean by a “good” genome?***\n\nA *good* genome assembly is typically one that is:\n\n- **Highly contiguous**  \n  Reads have been assembled into long sequences called *contigs*, ideally approaching full chromosome lengths.\n\n- **Biologically complete**  \n  Most expected genes are present (high BUSCO completeness).\n\n- **Structurally accurate**  \n  Large-scale errors such as mis-joins or collapsed repeats are minimised.\n\n\\\n\n***Assembly quality vs annotation quality***\n\nIt is important to distinguish between:\n\n**Genome assembly** i.e., the reconstructed DNA sequence itself, and the **Genome annotation**, which is the identification and labelling of genomic features, including gene structures (exons, introns, and CDS), non-coding RNAs (e.g., rRNA, tRNA and lncRNA), and associated identifiers such as gene_id, transcript_id, and database cross-references.\n\n\nA genome can be **well assembled but poorly annotated**, or vice versa.\n\n\n### EXERCISES 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (6 mins):\n\n***How would you describe these genomes?*** \n\nLook at the assembly stats and make some notes of how 'good' you think each assembly is.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n# EXERCISE #1 🧠🏋️‍♀️ (3 mins) - Human Genome Assembly\n[Human Genome assembly GRCh38.p14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.40/)\n\n![](figures/genome-assembly-human-01.png)\nNote: RefSeq is the curated database.

How did they assess this and what conclusion did they make about the eumetazoan ancestor resemblance to modern vertebrates, sea anemones and protosomes? Do you think they had a 'good' enough genome to assess this?  \n\n::: {.callout-warning appearance=\"minimal\"}\n# Extra for experts solution\n\n**NEED TO FACT CHECK THIS, COLLAPSE WHEN COMPLETE**\n\nThe authors used synteny analysis. They found many major genes, such as Hox genes, retained the same intron/exon structure in sea anemones as vertebrates, but this was not retained in model protosome species. Based on this they conlcuded that sea anemone genomes more closely resemble vertebrates than protosome species (fly, nematode, annelid) do. While the genome assembly itself is quite fragmented, the annotations are quite good, indicating that any conclusions the authors made comparing genomes and a gene stucture level are likely quite robust, but it would not be feasible with this assembly to make any conclusions based on larger genomic structure (i.e., at closer to chromosome level).   \n\n:::\n\n::: \n\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n:::\n\n\n#
