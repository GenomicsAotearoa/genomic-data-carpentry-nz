Now what?\n\n## Command-line interface (CLI) vs graphical user interface (GUI)\n\nCommand line interface (CLI) and graphic user interface (GUI) are different ways of interacting with a computer's operating system. They have different pros and cons. Most people are familiar with the GUI as it is the default interface for most software, particularly on Windows and Mac OS. When using the GUI, you see and interact with visual representations of files, folders, applications, and most other functions of your computer. When using the CLI, you work largely with text representations of software, files, folders, input and output. The shell is a program that allows you to control your computer by typing instructions on the CLI with a keyboard.\n\nThere are several reasons to learn how to use the CLI:\n\n- For most bioinformatics tools, there are no graphical interfaces. **If you want to work in metagenomics or genomics, you're going to need to use the CLI/ shell.**  \n- The shell gives you power. The command line allows you to work more efficiently. Tasks that are repetitive (e.g. renaming hundreds of files) can be automated. Tasks that are tedious (e.g. testing a range of input parameters) can be simplified.  \n- To use remote computers or cloud computing, you often need to use the shell.\n\nHere we will show you a quick introduction to using the shell to quality check your raw reads. For more on the shell, see our workshops on [Introduction to Shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-shell-for-bioinformatics) and \n[Intermediate Shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#intermediate-shell-for-bioinformatics). \n\n>Note: you'll hear the terms 'shell', 'bash', 'unix', 'terminal' and 'command-line' used almost interchangeably. For beginners, you can think of them as essentially all the same thing! As you gain more computational skills, you can dig into the differences.    \n\n## First, check that the data are not corrupt\n\nBelieve it or not, computers can make mistakes! When your data files are being copied over from the sequencing facility to cloud storage, errors can occur that cause your files to become corrupted. This is not always obvious based on file size or a quick look at the contents. The first thing you'll want to do is run a checksum, which will output a fixed-length message of 16 bytes-- a unique identifier of each file. The files should also come with the checksums run by the technician at the sequencing facility. Check out the section on [Data Integrity in our GA shell workshop](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/shell-for-bioinformatics/2_download_data/) for more information on how to run this. \n\n\n## Understanding genomic file types\n\nThe files you will get back from the sequencing facility will most likely end in `.fastq.gz`\n\nThe `.gz` indicates it is a compressed gzip file. For most genomic analyses, you do not need to unzip these first--this saves you storage space, as unzipped files can be double or triple the zipped size!\n\nThe `fastq` indicates the file is in [FASTQ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format). FASTQ files are a text-based format that stores the raw read sequences, along with a quality score for each base.\n\nHere are the first 4 lines of a fastq file:\n\n![](figures/fastq-reads.png)\n\nThe **first line is the header information**, beginning always with an `@`{style=\"color:black\"}.\nThis is the instrument-specific, run identifier and read identifiying information.  \n\n- `V350304715`{style=\"color:black\"} = instrument-specific  \n- `L3`{style=\"color:black\"} = lane 3 on the flow cell. Can be used for troubleshooting if something globally went wrong with sequencing.  \n- `C001`{style=\"color:black\"} = cluster identifier (can be used for troubleshooting, same as above).  \n- `R001`{style=\"color:black\"} = Read 1. All the reads in this file are read 1. If you have paired-end data, you'll have a corresponding read 2 file.  \n- `00020454`{style=\"color:black\"} = unique identifier for that read. \n- `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} = indicates this is a pair member. Only paired-end data have the `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} or `/2`{style=\"color:black\"} additional identifier.  \n\nEach instrument and chemistry will have slightly different header information. The main thing to look out for are indications of the data being read 1 or read 2 (indicates antisense or sense strand data, for protocols that can differentiate strandedness) and whether it is part of a mate pair (indicated by the `/1`{style=\"color:black\"} or `/2`{style=\"color:black\"})\n\nThe **second line is the actual sequence**. Count the number of bases --which read length was chosen for this dataset?\n\nThe **third line is just a \"+\"**. This can be optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.\n\nThe **fourth line is the quality score**. Each base in line 2 has a corresponding quality score, indicated by an ASCII character in line 4. \n\nFrom left to right, these are the quality scores in increasing order of quality:\n\n```\n!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~\n```\n\nSo, if a single base has a quality score of `!`{style=\"color:black\"}, which corresponds to a Q-score of 0, this indicates exceptionally poor quality. The sequencing machine was not able to resolve which base it should be. Often these will be shown as N's. \n\nConversely, if a single base has a quality score of `I`{style=\"color:black\"}, which corresponds to a Q-score of 40, this indicates very high quality. The sequencing machine was \"very confident\" that the base called is correct (Q40 indicates an error rate of 0.0001, i.e., a 1 in 10,000 chance of the base being called wrong. `I`{style=\"color:black\"} is near the upper end of typically achieved quality values, but higher is possible. \n\nFor more on quality scores, you can also read this [Illumina guide here](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/files-used-by-basespace/quality-scores). Note there are different types of encoding, but you will most frequently encounter [Phred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score)+33.\n\nWe can assess the quality score across all reads using software called [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and trim down reads to remove poorer quality bases below a set threshold (generally with newer sequence data, you can use Q30 or Q40 as a cut-off). We won't cover trimming here, see our workshop on [RNA-seq Data Analysis](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#rna-seq-data-analysis) for a step-by-step guide. \n\n\n\n### Other genomic file types \n\nWe've talked about `fastq` and `gz` files types, but there are some other common genomic file types you should know about.\n\nYou should also be aware that the extension on the file type is largely there just so you as a human know what kind of file it is. When using the CLI, the computer does not care what the extension says. \n\n| Extension | Name                    | Description                                                                 |\n|----------:|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `.fasta` or `.fa`, `.fna`, `.faa`    | FASTA, FASTA nucleic acid, FASTA amino acid | Contains sequence data. Each sequence starts with a single header line starting with a `>`{style=\"color:black\"}, followed by the nucleotide (or amino acid in case of `.faa`) sequence on the second line. No quality encoding included.  |\n| `.bam` `.sam`  | **B**inary/**S**equence Alignment Map  | Contains alignment information of your reads/sequences that are mapped against a reference sequence (e.g., genome). BAM are the compressed, computer-readable only version; SAM are human-readable but larger files. Somewhat interchangeable file types.  |\n| `.vcf`    | Variant Call Format     | Contains sequence variants called relative to a reference genome. Split into two sections; the header information and the records. See our [Intro R workshop, section on VCF files](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/Introduction-to-R/02-data-prelude/#how-variant-calls-are-stored-in-vcf-files).  |\n| `.gtf`    | General Feature Format    | Contains genome annotation data.   |\n\n\nbed file?\n\n**Real examples:**\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# FASTA\n\nFASTA file containing cds data from a genome, opened in a text editor:\n![](figures/fasta-file.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# BAM/SAM\nadd screenshots!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# VCF\n\nVCF file opened in excel:\n![](figures/vcf-file.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n# GTF\n\nGTF file opened in a text editor:\n![](figures/gtf-file.png)\n:::\n\n\n## FASTQC - quality scoring of raw reads\n\n- fastqc in depth  (use to teach intro shell )\n\n\n\n## Good vs bad genomes\n\nSomewhat colloquially, you will hear geneticists refer to \"good\" genome assemblies and \"bad\" genome assemblies. But how do you know if the species you are working on has a good or bad genome, if it has one at all?\n\nThere are a few metrics we use\n\nN50\nbusco score \ncontig level, scaffold level, chromosome level. \n\nShow two exmaples screenshot from NCBI of good and bad. (and excellent?)\n\nThere also can be a good assembly - highly contiguos sequence (once the reads are assembled into bigger strings we call them contigs), as clsoe to actual chromosoems as possible\nand with it may or may not have good annotations - this is actually describing where all the genomic features are, e.g., gene start and end points, intron and exon coordinates, promoter regions, which genes are protein-coding, pseudogenes, snoRNA, tRNA, CDS, gene_id ; transcript_id ; db_xref \n\n\n## Good vs bad genomes\n\nYou will often hear geneticists refer (somewhat colloquially) to *“good”* and *“bad”* genome assemblies. But what does this actually mean? And how can you tell whether a species you are working on has a good genome assembly?\n\nIn practice, we assess genome assemblies using a few metrics that capture **contiguity** and **completeness**.\n\n***Common genome assembly metrics***\n\n- **Contiguity** is often measured as contig N50, which is the length cutoff for the longest contigs that contain 50% of the total genome length. In this era of long-read genome assemblies, a contig N50 over 1 Mb is generally considered good. [Excerpt taken from PacBio article.](https://www.pacb.com/blog/beyond-contiguity/)\n\n  Also see [Wiki entry on N50/L50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N50,_L50,_and_related_statistics).  \n\n- **Completeness** is often measured using a BUSCO (**B**enchmarking **U**niversal **S**ingle-**C**opy **O**rthologs) score, which measures completeness using sets of conserved, single-copy genes expected to be present in most species within a specified lineage. \n\nReported as percentages of complete, duplicated, fragmented, and missing genes. <- change to example. \n\n**Describing assembly level**  \nGenome assemblies can be described more qualitatively as (in order of less to more complete):\n\n  - **Contig-level** – sequences are assembled but not ordered or oriented  \n  - **Scaffold-level** – contigs linked together, often with gaps  \n  - **Chromosome-level** – scaffolds arranged into full chromosomes, often using Hi-C or linkage data\n\n\n\n***What do we mean by a “good” genome?***\n\nA *good* genome assembly is typically one that is:\n\n- **Highly contiguous**  \n  Reads have been assembled into long sequences called *contigs*, ideally approaching full chromosome lengths.\n\n- **Biologically complete**  \n  Most expected genes are present (high BUSCO completeness).\n\n- **Structurally accurate**  \n  Large-scale errors such as mis-joins or collapsed repeats are minimised.\n\n\n***Assembly quality vs annotation quality***\n\nIt is important to distinguish between:\n\n**Genome assembly** i.e., the reconstructed DNA sequence itself, and the **Genome annotation**, which is the identification and labelling of genomic features, including gene structures (exons, introns, and CDS), non-coding RNAs (e.g., rRNA, tRNA and lncRNA), and associated identifiers such as `gene_id`, `transcript_id`, and database cross-references.\n\n\nA genome can be **well assembled but poorly annotated**, or vice versa.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Genomic data wrangling and processing\n\nYour data is now on a server/cloud/local computer, ready for analysis.
