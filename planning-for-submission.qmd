# Planning for submission

You've done your experiment, extracted some DNA or RNA, and want to sequence it, but now what?

- flow cells 101, millions of reads vs smaples  
- workign with NZ sequencing facilities   
- fastq, gz, r1 and r2 files  
- illumina vs pacbio vs nanopore 

## Sequencing libraries  

The first thing that needs to be done for Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing is to turn the DNA or RNA sample into something called a *library*. This converts the raw nucleic acids into a form that the sequencer can actually read. This is generally done by the technician that will also sequence your samples, but some labs may do library prep in-house (i.e., *you* may do it yourself!). Nanopore is a little different, in that it can sequence native RNA directly, with minimal prep before sequencing. DNA library preparation for ONT sequencing is also generally simpler than for Illumina and PacBio. This is because the technology used to sequence the DNA/RNA using ONT is quite different to how Illumina and PacBio achieve it--more on that in the next section on flow cells.


Library preparation (for Illumina and PacBio) generally involves the following steps, and takes 1-2 days in the lab: 

1. **(Optional) Target enrichment / RNA selection**  
Selectively enriching for your target molecule (e.g., for standard RNAseq you likely will do polyA capture).  
2. **(RNAseq only)** Converting your RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase.  
3. **Fragmentation (if needed**)
Some kits fragment RNA before reverse transcription, others fragment cDNA/DNA after.  
This ensures fragments are the right size for the platform (e.g., ~200–400 bp for Illumina).

4. **End repair and A-tailing**  
Ends are cleaned up so adapters can be ligated efficiently.

5. **Adapter ligation**  
Adapters are short sequences that enable library binding to the flow cell (Illumina) or capture for SMRTbells (PacBio).  
Some kits combine this with indexing.  

6. **Indexing (barcoding)**  
Indices allow multiple samples to be pooled together and sequenced on the same flow cell, then computationally separated afterward (called mulitplexing and demultiplexing).      

7. **Size selection / cleanup**  
Typically done with magnetic beads to remove adapter dimers and select the desired fragment range.  

8. **Library amplification (if required)**  
Some protocols use PCR to enrich adapter-ligated molecules; others (e.g., some PacBio) are PCR-free.  

9. **Final QC and quantification**  
Using Qubit, Bioanalyzer/Tapestation/Fragment Analyzer, etc. This step ensures your library meets sequencing requirements.  

There are different library prep methods for each platform that you will also need to chose. This will depend on a few things, such as:  

- The quality of your RNA/DNA (e.g., high-quality RNA allows polyA selection; degraded samples may require ribo-depletion or specialised kits).    
- The species/tissue type you extracted your RNA/DNA from (e.g., plants have rRNA types that require plant-specific depletion kits, some tissues have high mitochondrial RNA content).    
- The type of analysis you want to do i.e., what is your research question  

For example, if you are doing a 'standard' Illumina RNA sequencing project (e.g,. you plan to do differential gene expression analysis to compare different samples), a  common choice is **Illumina stranded mRNA library prep**, which uses polyA selection to capture mRNA.  However, you may chose **Illumina total RNA library prep** with ribo-depletion, which is more expensive, but it has some advantages such as: it can capture non-polyadenylated RNAs (more comprehensive RNA profile) and and is a better option if your samples are partially degraded (it can also handle FFPE samples).  

#### DISCUSSION 💬

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Why do you think polyA capture is used for 'standard' RNAseq?

Mature mRNAs have polyA tails, which can be selectively isolated using oligo DT coated beads that bind mature RNAs only. All other non-polyadenylated nucleic acids and cellular debris can then be washed away.

# Why do you think we bother adding “index” sequences to libraries at all? Why not sequence each sample separately?

Indexing (barcoding) allows multiple samples to be pooled in a single sequencing run. This massively reduces cost and time. Because each library carries a unique index, the sequencer can mix them together, and downstream software can computationally separate (demultiplex) them accurately afterward.

# Why do you think size selection is such an important step? What would happen if we skipped it?

Size selection ensures that fragments fall within the size range the sequencer expects. Without it, you may get:

- adapter dimers (which waste sequencing reads as they take up 'real estate')  

- too-short fragments (which cluster preferentially, causing over-representation and distorts the data e.g., sequencing may read into adapters or flow cell)    
- too-long fragments (which may not fully sequence or reduce yield)

## Flow cells and sequencing platforms 101

A flow cell is the physical surface inside the sequencing machine (or platform) where the actual reading of DNA or RNA occurs. Although Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) all call their consumables “flow cells,” the underlying technologies are very different.

For the most part, and in-depth knowledge of how these flow cells work is not needed to get you started with your sequencing project. 

Here are the basic differences:

| Feature | Illumina | PacBio (HiFi / SMRT) | Oxford Nanopore (ONT) |
|--------|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **How sequencing works** | Sequencing-by-synthesis (fluorescent nucleotides added one base at a time) | Single-molecule real-time sequencing (polymerase incorporates fluorescent bases inside ZMWs) | Nanopore sensing (changes in ionic current as DNA/RNA passes through a pore) |
| **Flow cell structure** | Patterned flow cell with billions of oligos that form clonal clusters | SMRT Cell containing millions of Zero-Mode Waveguides (ZMWs) | Membrane embedded with thousands of protein nanopores |
| **What binds to the flow cell** | Libraries bind via adapters to oligos → amplified into clusters | A single SMRTbell + polymerase complex loads into each ZMW | DNA or RNA strand with a motor protein threads into a nanopore |
| **Signal detected** | Fluorescent signal imaged each cycle | Fluorescent flashes when each base is incorporated | Changes in electrical current across the pore |
| **Amplification?** | Yes — cluster generation required | No — true single-molecule reads | No (PCR-free), though can use PCR in library prep |
| **Typical read length** | 100–300 bp | 10–25 kb HiFi reads | 10 kb to >100 kb (ultra-long >1 Mb possible) |
| **Can sequence native RNA?** | No | No | Yes — direct RNA sequencing |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, high throughput, cost-efficient | Highly accurate long reads; excellent for haplotype resolution | Ultra-long reads; portable; real-time analysis; can detect base mods |
| **Limitations** | Short reads only | Lower throughput than Illumina; expensive | Higher raw error rate; pore lifetime limits yield |
| **Best used for** | Standard RNA-seq (DGE); de novo transcriptomes; high-depth short-read assays; metagenomics; error-correcting long reads | Genome assembly (chromosome-level with HiFi); full-length RNA (Iso-Seq for isoforms); structural variant detection | Field-based sequencing (e.g, rapid microbial identification); genome assembly; native RNA including modification detection (e.g., methylation) |


Choosing a platform to do your sequencing comes down to the question you are trying to answer. See the table above 'Best use for' for some examples of why you might pick one platform over another.



#### Decision points 🤔

- The question is not *how many samples are you sequencing*, but rather, *how many reads do you need?* This will determine what size flow cell you need, and to some extent, which platform you will use, as different platforms have different capacity (e.g,. Illumna NextSeq is a medium size platform, NovaSeq is a larger size platform). The number of reads you need scale with the size of the genome and/or complexity of your transcriptome.

- Are you doing all your samples in one batch, or will you have multiple batches? Technical variation can occur, so you may want to wait and do all samples at once on one larger flow cell, or make sure you randomise samples across sequencing batches.
