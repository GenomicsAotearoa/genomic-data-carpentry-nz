# Genomic Data Carpentry (Aotearoa edition)

![](theme-images/GDC-A_image.png)

## Getting started with genomics

This is a beginner-friendly workshop, designed to get you started with the world of genomics. Whatever you're doing---whether it's transcriptomics, genome assembly, variant calling, metagenomics, or something else---if you will be using genomic data this workshop is for you! 

## What's covered in this workshop

- Organisation---from messy lab books and excel spreadsheets to tidy, computer-friendly data  
- Working with sequencing facilities and understanding genomic data types  
- Data storage repositories, public services and facilities, and principles of FAIR and CARE 
- Quality control, wrangling of raw reads and an introduction to genomic terminology  

## What's NOT covered in this workshop

- Non-NGS sequencing and services (e.g., Sanger sequencing, qPCR, genotyping, probe-based applications such as microarrays and NanoString nCounter)  
- Genomic analysis pipelines (beyond the basics of initial quality checks of raw reads) 
- The basics of cluster or HPC resourcing and specialised software (e.g., we do not cover schedulers such as SLURM, partitions/CPUs/GPUs, chosing compute allocation allowance). See our workshop on [Introduction to Bash Scripting and HPC Job Scheduler](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-bash-scripting-and-hpc-job-scheduler) for this.
- Using shell, beyond the very basics (e.g., we do not cover writing/submitting bash scripts, modules, accessing the cluster using ssh)
