## Getting started with genomics

This is a beginner-friendly workshop, designed to get you started with the world of genomics. Whatever you're doing---whether it's transcriptomics, genome assembly, variant calling, metagenomics, or something else---if you will be using genomic data this workshop is for you! 

## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to have a basic (undergraduate) level understanding of biological and genetic concepts, but no familiarity with genomics or bioinformatic/computational skill is required.

## What's covered in this workshop

- Ethical data collection from a New Zealand perspective
- Organisation---from messy lab books and excel spreadsheets to tidy, computer-friendly data  
- Working with sequencing facilities and understanding genomic data types  
- Data storage repositories and public services and facilities  
- Quality control, wrangling of raw reads and an introduction to genomic terminology  

## What's NOT covered in this workshop

- Basic descriptions of biological and genetic concepts.  
- Traditional sequencing and services (e.g., Sanger sequencing, qPCR, genotyping, probe-based applications such as microarrays and NanoString nCounter).  
- Genomic analysis workflows. We have multiple dedicated workshops for genomic pipelines; see [our portfolio here](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html).    
- Using shell or other bioinformatic tools. See our workshops on [Introduction to shell](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-shell-for-bioinformatics) and [Introduction to R](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#intermediate-r-for-bioinformatics) to get you started on this. 
- Understanding the cluster, HPC resourcing and specialised software (e.g., we do not cover schedulers such as SLURM, partitions/CPUs/GPUs, choosing compute allocation allowance). See our workshop on [Introduction to Bash Scripting and HPC Job Scheduler](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/BioinformaticsTrainingProgramme/portfolio.html#introduction-to-bash-scripting-and-hpc-job-scheduler) for this.  

## Glossary

| Term  | Definition |
|----|--------------|
| Adapter  | Short synthetic DNA sequence ligated to the DNA molecule during library prep which allows the molecule to bind to the flow cell during sequencing and also provides a primer binding site |
| bp   | Base pair |
| DGE   | Differential Gene Expression (analysis) |
| HCS   | High Capacity Storage |
| HPC   | High Performance Computing |
| HiFi   | High fidelity (PacBio) |
| Index | Also known as a barcode. Short unique sequence added to each DNA molecule in one library, allowing the identification of that library/sample and thereby enabling pooling of the libraries for sequencing (one run = cheaper). |
| Gb   | Gigabase pair (1,000,000,000 bp) |
| GB   | Gigabyte (file size / storage size) |
| Mb   | Megabase pair (1,000,000 bp) |
| MB   | Megabyte (file size / storage size) |
| Multiplexing   | Sequencing multiple samples simultaneously in one run by combining libraries into one pool. Samples (i.e., libraries) are de-multiplexed (separated) *in silico* usually by the technician, based on unique indices.  |
| NGS  | Next-generation sequencing |
| ONT  | Oxford Nanopore Technologies (sequencing company). Often referred to as "Nanopore".  |
| PacBio | Pacific Biosystems (sequencing company) |
| Resequencing | Sequencing part of an individual's genome in order to detect sequence differences between the individual and the standard genome of the species. Often performed to detect SNPs, genotypes, variants.  |
| SE / PE | Single-end / Paired-end |
| SMRT | Single molecule real time (PacBio) |
