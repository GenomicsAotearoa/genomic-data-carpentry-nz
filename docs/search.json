    "text": "You’ve done your experiment, extracted some DNA or RNA, and want to sequence it, but now what?\n\nflow cells 101, millions of reads vs smaples\n\nworkign with NZ sequencing facilities\n\nfastq, gz, r1 and r2 files\n\nillumina vs pacbio vs nanopore\n\n\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done for Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing is to turn the DNA or RNA sample into something called a library. This converts the raw nucleic acids into a form that the sequencer can actually read. This is generally done by the technician that will also sequence your samples, but some labs may do library prep in-house (i.e., you may do it yourself!). Nanopore is a little different, in that it can sequence native RNA directly, with minimal prep before sequencing. DNA library preparation for ONT sequencing is also generally simpler than for Illumina and PacBio. This is because the technology used to sequence the DNA/RNA using ONT is quite different to how Illumina and PacBio achieve it–more on that in the next section on flow cells.\nLibrary preparation (for Illumina and PacBio) generally involves the following steps, and takes 1-2 days in the lab:\n\n(Optional) Target enrichment / RNA selection\nSelectively enriching for your target molecule (e.g., for standard RNAseq you likely will do polyA capture).\n\n(RNAseq only) Converting your RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase.\n\nFragmentation (if needed) Some kits fragment RNA before reverse transcription, others fragment cDNA/DNA after.\nThis ensures fragments are the right size for the platform (e.g., ~200–400 bp for Illumina).\nEnd repair and A-tailing\nEnds are cleaned up so adapters can be ligated efficiently.\nAdapter ligation\nAdapters are short sequences that enable library binding to the flow cell (Illumina) or capture for SMRTbells (PacBio).\nSome kits combine this with indexing.\nIndexing (barcoding)\nIndices allow multiple samples to be pooled together and sequenced on the same flow cell, then computationally separated afterward (called mulitplexing and demultiplexing).\nSize selection / cleanup\nTypically done with magnetic beads to remove adapter dimers and select the desired fragment range.\nLibrary amplification (if required)\nSome protocols use PCR to enrich adapter-ligated molecules; others (e.g., some PacBio) are PCR-free.\nFinal QC and quantification\nUsing Qubit, Bioanalyzer/Tapestation/Fragment Analyzer, etc. This step ensures your library meets sequencing requirements.\n\nThere are different library prep methods for each platform that you will also need to chose. This will depend on a few things, such as:\n\nThe quality of your RNA/DNA (e.g., high-quality RNA allows polyA selection; degraded samples may require ribo-depletion or specialised kits).\n\nThe species/tissue type you extracted your RNA/DNA from (e.g., plants have rRNA types that require plant-specific depletion kits, some tissues have high mitochondrial RNA content).\n\nThe type of analysis you want to do i.e., what is your research question\n\nFor example, if you are doing a ‘standard’ Illumina RNA sequencing project (e.g,. you plan to do differential gene expression analysis to compare different samples), a common choice is Illumina stranded mRNA library prep, which uses polyA selection to capture mRNA. However, you may chose Illumina total RNA library prep with ribo-depletion, which is more expensive, but it has some advantages such as: it can capture non-polyadenylated RNAs (more comprehensive RNA profile) and and is a better option if your samples are partially degraded (it can also handle FFPE samples).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think polyA capture is used for ‘standard’ RNAseq?\n\n\n\n\n\nMature mRNAs have polyA tails, which can be selectively isolated using oligo DT coated beads that bind mature RNAs only. All other non-polyadenylated nucleic acids and cellular debris can then be washed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think we bother adding “index” sequences to libraries at all? Why not sequence each sample separately?\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing (barcoding) allows multiple samples to be pooled in a single sequencing run. This massively reduces cost and time. Because each library carries a unique index, the sequencer can mix them together, and downstream software can computationally separate (demultiplex) them accurately afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think size selection is such an important step? What would happen if we skipped it?\n\n\n\n\n\nSize selection ensures that fragments fall within the size range the sequencer expects. Without it, you may get:\n\nadapter dimers (which waste sequencing reads as they take up ‘real estate’)\ntoo-short fragments (which cluster preferentially, causing over-representation and distorts the data e.g., sequencing may read into adapters or flow cell)\n\ntoo-long fragments (which may not fully sequence or reduce yield)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA flow cell is the physical surface inside the sequencing machine (or platform) where the actual reading of DNA or RNA occurs. Although Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) all call their consumables “flow cells,” the underlying technologies are very different.\nFor the most part, and in-depth knowledge of how these flow cells work is not needed to get you started with your sequencing project.\nHere are the basic differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nIllumina\nPacBio (HiFi / SMRT)\nOxford Nanopore (ONT)\n\n\n\n\nHow sequencing works\nSequencing-by-synthesis (fluorescent nucleotides added one base at a time)\nSingle-molecule real-time sequencing (polymerase incorporates fluorescent bases inside ZMWs)\nNanopore sensing (changes in ionic current as DNA/RNA passes through a pore)\n\n\nFlow cell structure\nPatterned flow cell with billions of oligos that form clonal clusters\nSMRT Cell containing millions of Zero-Mode Waveguides (ZMWs)\nMembrane embedded with thousands of protein nanopores\n\n\nWhat binds to the flow cell\nLibraries bind via adapters to oligos → amplified into clusters\nA single SMRTbell + polymerase complex loads into each ZMW\nDNA or RNA strand with a motor protein threads into a nanopore\n\n\nSignal detected\nFluorescent signal imaged each cycle\nFluorescent flashes when each base is incorporated\nChanges in electrical current across the pore\n\n\nAmplification?\nYes — cluster generation required\nNo — true single-molecule reads\nNo (PCR-free), though can use PCR in library prep\n\n\nTypical read length\n100–300 bp\n10–25 kb HiFi reads\n10 kb to &gt;100 kb (ultra-long &gt;1 Mb possible)\n\n\nCan sequence native RNA?\nNo\nNo\nYes — direct RNA sequencing\n\n\nStrengths\nHigh accuracy, high throughput, cost-efficient\nHighly accurate long reads; excellent for haplotype resolution\nUltra-long reads; portable; real-time analysis; can detect base mods\n\n\nLimitations\nShort reads only\nLower throughput than Illumina; expensive\nHigher raw error rate; pore lifetime limits yield\n\n\nBest used for\nStandard RNA-seq (DGE); de novo transcriptomes; high-depth short-read assays; metagenomics; error-correcting long reads\nGenome assembly (chromosome-level with HiFi); full-length RNA (Iso-Seq for isoforms); structural variant detection\nField-based sequencing (e.g, rapid microbial identification); genome assembly; native RNA including modification detection (e.g., methylation)\n\n\n\nChoosing a platform to do your sequencing comes down to the question you are trying to answer. See the table above ‘Best use for’ for some examples of why you might pick one platform over another.\n\n\n\nThe question is not how many samples are you sequencing, but rather, how many reads do you need? This will determine what size flow cell you need, and to some extent, which platform you will use, as different platforms have different capacity (e.g,.

It not only sets you up well for an analysis, but it also makes it easier to come back to the project later and share with collaborators, including your most important collaborator - future you.\nOrganising a project that includes sequencing involves many components. There’s the experimental setup and conditions metadata, measurements of experimental parameters, sequencing preparation and sample information, the sequences themselves and the files and workflow of any bioinformatics analysis. So much of the information of a sequencing project is digital, and we need to keep track of our digital records in the same way we have a lab notebook and sample freezer. In this lesson, we’ll go through the project organisation and documentation that will make an efficient bioinformatics workflow possible. Not only will this make you a more effective bioinformatics researcher, it also prepares your data and project for publication, as grant agencies and publishers increasingly require this information.\n\n\nWhen we think about the data for a sequencing project, we often start by thinking about the sequencing data that we get back from the sequencing centre. However, equally or more important is the data you’ve generated about the sequences before it ever goes to the sequencing centre. This is the data about the data, often called the metadata. Without the information about what you sequenced, the sequence data itself is useless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXERCISE 🧠🏋️‍♀️ - 3 mins\n\n\n\nWhat kind of data and information have you generated (or think you will generate) about your samples that can be considered metadata?

Use ‘-’, ’_’ or camel case instead of a space.
