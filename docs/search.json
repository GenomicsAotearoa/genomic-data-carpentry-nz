    "text": "You’ve done your experiment, extracted some DNA or RNA, and want to sequence it, but now what?\n\n\nShort section. Need to pass ceraint cut offs, do nanopdrop qubit bioanalyzer. the seq facility will ask for these in teh submission form. MOre on submission later (last section)\n\n\n\nThe first thing that needs to be done for Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing is to turn the DNA or RNA sample into something called a library. This converts the raw nucleic acids into a form that the sequencer can actually read. This is generally done by the technician that will also sequence your samples, but some labs may do library prep in-house (i.e., you may do it yourself!). Nanopore is a little different, in that it can sequence native RNA directly, with minimal prep before sequencing. DNA library preparation for ONT sequencing is also generally simpler than for Illumina and PacBio. This is because the technology used to sequence the DNA/RNA using ONT is quite different to how Illumina and PacBio achieve it–more on that in the next section on flow cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllumina lib prep molecular workflow diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary preparation (for Illumina and PacBio) generally involves the following steps, and takes 1-2 days in the lab:\n\n(Optional) Target enrichment / RNA selection\nSelectively enriching for your target molecule (e.g., for standard RNAseq you likely will do polyA capture).\n\n(RNAseq only) Converting your RNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase.\n\nFragmentation (if needed) Some kits fragment RNA before reverse transcription, others fragment cDNA/DNA after.\nThis ensures fragments are the right size for the platform (e.g., ~200–400 bp for Illumina).\nEnd repair and A-tailing\nEnds are cleaned up so adapters can be ligated efficiently.\nAdapter ligation\nAdapters are short sequences that enable library binding to the flow cell (Illumina) or capture for SMRTbells (PacBio).\nSome kits combine this with indexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPacBio lib prep - SMRTbell adapters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: the SMRTbell technology allows HiFi (high fidelity) long read sequencing. The DNA becomes circularised, which allows the polymerase to make repeated passes around the DNA and the consensus sequence therefore has a higher accuracy than single pass sequencing.\n\n\n\n\nIndexing (barcoding)\nIndices allow multiple samples to be pooled together and sequenced on the same flow cell, then computationally separated afterward (called mulitplexing and demultiplexing).\nSize selection / cleanup\nTypically done with magnetic beads to remove adapter dimers and select the desired fragment range.\nLibrary amplification (if required)\nSome protocols use PCR to enrich adapter-ligated molecules; others (e.g., some PacBio) are PCR-free.\nFinal QC and quantification\nUsing Qubit, Bioanalyzer/Tapestation/Fragment Analyzer, etc. This step ensures your library meets sequencing requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBioanalyzer trace of final library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are different library prep methods for each platform that you will also need to chose. This will depend on a few things, such as:\n\nThe quality of your RNA/DNA (e.g., high-quality RNA allows polyA selection; degraded samples may require ribo-depletion or specialised kits).\n\nThe species/tissue type you extracted your RNA/DNA from (e.g., plants have rRNA types that require plant-specific depletion kits, some tissues have high mitochondrial RNA content).\n\nThe type of analysis you want to do i.e., what is your research question\n\nFor example, if you are doing a ‘standard’ Illumina RNA sequencing project (e.g,. you plan to do differential gene expression analysis to compare different samples), a common choice is Illumina stranded mRNA library prep, which uses polyA selection to capture mRNA. However, you may chose Illumina total RNA library prep with ribo-depletion, which is more expensive, but it has some advantages such as: it can capture non-polyadenylated RNAs (more comprehensive RNA profile) and and is a better option if your samples are partially degraded (it can also handle FFPE samples).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think polyA capture is used for ‘standard’ RNAseq?\n\n\n\n\n\nMature mRNAs have polyA tails, which can be selectively isolated using oligo DT coated beads that bind mature RNAs only. All other non-polyadenylated nucleic acids and cellular debris can then be washed away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think we bother adding “index” sequences to libraries at all? Why not sequence each sample separately?\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing (barcoding) allows multiple samples to be pooled in a single sequencing run. This massively reduces cost and time. Because each library carries a unique index, the sequencer can mix them together, and downstream software can computationally separate (demultiplex) them accurately afterward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think size selection is such an important step? What would happen if we skipped it?\n\n\n\n\n\nSize selection ensures that fragments fall within the size range the sequencer expects. Without it, you may get:\n\nadapter dimers (which waste sequencing reads as they take up ‘real estate’)\ntoo-short fragments (which cluster preferentially, causing over-representation and distorts the data e.g., sequencing may read into adapters or flow cell)\n\ntoo-long fragments (which may not fully sequence or reduce yield)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three major sequencing platform and consumables companies are Illumina, PacBio (Pacific Biosystems) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Each make different platforms/instruments that can handle different levels of throughput, but the chemistry and the ‘reading’ of the sequencing is the main point of difference between the three companies.\nA few examples of the different platforms are:\nIllumina\n\nMiSeq\n\nNextSeq\n\nNovaSeq\n\nPacBio\n\nSequel II\n\nRevio\n\nOxford Nanopore Technologies\n\nMinION\n\nGridION\n\nPromethION\n\nA flow cell is the physical surface inside the sequencing machine (or platform) where the actual reading of DNA or RNA occurs. There are different sizes you can chose from, depending on how many reads you need. Although Illumina, PacBio, and ONT all call their consumables “flow cells,” the underlying technologies are very different.\nFor the most part, and in-depth knowledge of how these flow cells work is not needed to get you started with your sequencing project.\nHere are the basic differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nIllumina\nPacBio (HiFi / SMRT)\nOxford Nanopore (ONT)\n\n\n\n\nHow sequencing works\nSequencing-by-synthesis (fluorescent nucleotides added one base at a time)\nSingle-molecule real-time sequencing (polymerase incorporates fluorescent bases inside ZMWs)\nNanopore sensing (changes in ionic current as DNA/RNA passes through a pore)\n\n\nFlow cell structure\nPatterned flow cell with billions of oligos that form clonal clusters\nSMRT Cell containing millions of Zero-Mode Waveguides (ZMWs)\nMembrane embedded with thousands of protein nanopores\n\n\nWhat binds to the flow cell\nLibraries bind via adapters to oligos → amplified into clusters\nA single SMRTbell + polymerase complex loads into each ZMW\nDNA or RNA strand with a motor protein threads into a nanopore\n\n\nSignal detected\nFluorescent signal imaged each cycle\nFluorescent flashes when each base is incorporated\nChanges in electrical current across the pore\n\n\nAmplification?\nYes — cluster generation required\nNo — true single-molecule reads\nNo (PCR-free), though can use PCR in library prep\n\n\nTypical read length\n100–300 bp\n10–25 kb HiFi reads\n10 kb to &gt;100 kb (ultra-long &gt;1 Mb possible)\n\n\nCan sequence native RNA?\nNo — convert to cDNA library\nNo — convert to cDNA library\nYes — direct RNA sequencing\n\n\nStrengths\nHigh accuracy, high throughput, cost-efficient, chemistry highly compatible with different species/tissues\nHighly accurate long reads; excellent for haplotype resolution\nUltra-long reads; portable; real-time analysis; can detect base mods\n\n\nLimitations\nShort reads only\nLower throughput than Illumina; expensive\nHigher raw error rate; pore lifetime limits yield and susceptible to clogging\n\n\nBest used for\nStandard RNA-seq (DGE); de novo transcriptomes; high-depth short-read assays; metagenomics; error-correcting long reads\nGenome assembly (chromosome-level with HiFi); full-length RNA (Iso-Seq for isoforms); structural variant detection\nField-based sequencing (e.g, rapid microbial identification); genome assembly; native RNA including modification detection (e.g., methylation)\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a platform to do your sequencing comes down to the question you are trying to answer. See the last row in the table above ‘Best use for’ for some examples of why you might pick one platform over another!\nWhen you get in contact with a sequencing facility, the question they will ask you is not how many samples are you sequencing, but rather, how many reads do you need? This will determine what size flow cell you need, and to some extent, which platform you will use, as different platforms have different capacity (e.g,. Illumina NextSeq is a ‘medium throughput’ platform, NovaSeq is a ‘large throughput’ platform). The number of reads you need scale with the size of the genome and/or complexity of your transcriptome.\nAs a general rule of thumb, for transcriptome sequencing you will need:\nTable 1: Reads per sample\n\n\n\nPurpose / Type\nApprox reads per sample\n\n\n\n\nGene expression profiling\n5–25 million\n\n\nComplete expression + alternative splicing\n30–60+ million\n\n\nDe novo transcriptome assembly\n~100+ million\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing the sequencing facility will ask you if you are doing short-read sequencing (Illumina) is do you want single-end or paired-end reads. This refers to whether you want a single read (read 1), sequenced from only one end of the library molecule (fragment), or if you want two reads per library molecule (read 1 and read 2, antisense and sense strands). Paired-end costs more, but gives you more resolution.\nThere are pros and cons to choosing either chemistry:\nTable 2: Single-end vs paired-end chemistry (short-read Illumina sequencing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nSingle-end (SE)\nLower cost, fewer reads required (may be able to do more samples); sufficient for basic gene-level DGE\nLimited splice/isoform resolution; less confident mapping when mapping to a genome\n\n\nPaired-end (PE)\nBetter alignment; improved splice junction and isoform detection; more robust for complex transcriptomes or de novo transcriptome assembly\nHigher cost; ~2× sequencing required (two reads per fragment)\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, if you are doing short-read sequencing (i.e., Illumina), the sequencing facility will ask you what read length you want. You can typically chose from between 50bp-300bp (platform-dependent). The choice between a lower or higher read length will be a balance of cost (higher read length = higher cost) and the level of information you need (complex, novel or de novo transcriptomes require higher read lengths; more straight forward analyses with well-annotated genomes can utilise lower read lengths). In contrast, for long-read sequencing platforms (ONT and PacBio), you do not specify a fixed read length. Instead, reads are generated as single, continuous sequences, and their length is determined by the size of the input molecules, the library preparation method, and the sequencing chemistry.\nChoosing a read length is a trade-off between cost, and the amount of information you will recover:\nTable 3: Read length (short-read Illumina sequencing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead length\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n50 bp\nLowest cost; highest sample multiplexing; sufficient for basic gene-level DGE in well-annotated genomes\nPoor isoform and splice junction resolution; higher multi-mapping\n\n\n100 bp\nGood balance of cost and information; reliable splice junction detection; widely used for standard RNA-seq\nSlightly lower throughput than 50 bp; may miss very complex isoforms\n\n\n150 bp\nImproved isoform resolution; better mapping across repetitive regions; useful for novel transcript discovery\nHigher cost; fewer reads per run\n\n\n300 bp\nMaximum per-read information; helpful for de novo transcriptome assembly\nRarely necessary for Illumina RNA-seq; expensive; reduced throughput\n\n\n\n\n\nExample RNAseq scenario:\nYou are working on a mouse model of cancer genomics. You want to do differential gene expression analysis to compare tumour samples to non-cancerous control tissue, to see if you can find genes that are up or down regulated in the cancerous tissue. You have 40 RNA samples, and since your species has a high-quality reference genome and annotation (i.e., mouse: Mus musculus), you know you have a “good” genome assembly and annotations to map your sequencing data back to (more on “good” genomes later!). The mouse genome is ~2.7 Gb (= 2,700,000,000 bp), diploid, with ~20,000 protein-coding genes.\nYou are particularly interested in alternative splicing and novel splice junctions, as you suspect that cancer-associated genes are often regulated at the isoform level.\nYou will sequence your samples at the Otago Genomics Facility, and see on their website they have an Illumina MiSeq and an Illumina NextSeq 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich platform will you chose?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Illumina NextSeq 2000 is a ‘medium’ sized short read sequencing platform, ideal for standard RNAseq, and is well-suited to this project. It can output up to 540Gb.\nThe Illumina MiSeq is a ‘small’ sized short read sequencing platform, better suited to QC or amplicon sequencing, and can output up to 30Gb. It is too small for this project.\nIllumina benchtop sequencing platforms comparison\n\n\n\nNext you need to decide how many reads you need.\nBased on table 1 above, how many reads do you need per sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReads per sample choice:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou decide you need 30 million reads per sample. You pick the lower end of the scale, as you suspect the genes you are most interested in will be highly expressed, and don’t expect your tissue to have a particular high transcript diversity that would require more reads.\nYou work out what minimum output you need from the flow cell:\n30 mil reads * 40 samples = 1200 million reads (1.2B).\n\n\n\nNow you need to decide if you want paired-end or single end reads.\nBased on table 2 above, what would you pick?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired-end vs single end choice:\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired-end sequencing will give better detection of novel isoforms and splice junctions\nThis doubles the number of reads generated per fragment and will give you better resolution.\n\n\n\nYou now need to decide which read length you need. Given the mouse genome is well-annotated, but you are looking for potentially novel isoforms, which read length would you pick, based on table 3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead length choice:\n\n\n\n\n\n50 bp would be a good choice for a well-annotated genome like mouse for standard RNAseq, but does not suit this experiment, as you are looking for novel isoforms/alternative splicing.\n100bp is probably the best choice, balancing cost with novel isoform discovery.\nYou could also chose 150bp, if you want to be sure you’d capture novel isoforms, especially if they are quite long or complex genes - and don’t mind a higher cost.\n\n\n\nYou are now ready to pick your flow cell. Check out the Illumina NextSeq2000 flow cell specifications and chose which flow cell will suit this project best. There are four flow cells in ascending output size you can choose from: P1, P2, P3 and P4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich flow cell will you pick?\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on paired end sequencing using 100bp read length (i.e., 2 x 100bp):\nTotal reads needed for your experiment: 1.2 billion reads.\nCalculation: 1.2 billion reads x 100 (bp) x 2 (PE) = 240 Gb (240 gigabase pairs, or 240 billion individual DNA bases sequenced).\n\nP1 → No 100bp option and way too low\n\nP2 → 80 Gb (too low for 1.2B demand)\n\nP3 → 240 Gb (fits 1.2B reads requirement exactly)\n\nP4 → 360 Gb (oversized for this project)\n\nNote: the maximum output stated for the flow cell is under optimal conditions, so the P3 flow cell choice just fits, but it is possible you will have less reads then anticipated (e.g., instead of 30 mil reads per sample, you may get 28 mil per sample).\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You are now ready to sequence your RNAseq samples.\n \nFor Genome sequencing you will need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenome size\nExample species\nApprox genome size\nApprox reads per sample\n\n\n\n\nTiny\nVirus\n&lt;0.1 Mb\n0.1–0.5 million\n\n\nSmall\nBacteria\n5 Mb\n5–10 million\n\n\nMedium\nYeast\n12 Mb\n10–20 million\n\n\nLarge\nFruit fly (D. melanogaster)\n175 Mb\n50–100 million\n\n\nVery Large\nHuman\n3 Gb\n600–1,200 million\n\n\nHuge\nWheat\n16 Gb\n6–12 billion\n\n\n\nWhere Mb = megabase pairs (i.e., 1 Mb = 1,000,000 bp)\n\n\nExample DNAseq scenario:\nYou are want to de novo assemble the genome of the New Zealand swamp maire (Syzygium maire), a critically-endangered, endemic myrtaceae species, which is under threat from the pathogen myrtle rust.\nBased on genome sizes of related Syzygium and Myrtaceae species (e.g., Syzygium aromaticum ~370 Mb, S. grande ~405 Mb), you expect the S. maire genome to be on the order of ~350–400 Mb.\nDe novo genome assembly requires long read sequencing to resolve the longest contiguous sequences possible (ideally the full chromosome length, but that is often not easy to achieve!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich long-read sequencing platform should you chose?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two long-read platforms – PacBio and ONT. PacBio better for larger genomes than ONT? Ask someone who knows this to fill in.\n\n\n\ncoverage. talking about average coverage - really repetitive regions can have very low covergae, other more easily resolved sections will have higher coverage.\nheterozygosity homozygosity.\nBalkwill et al. 2024. Tree Genetics & Genomes.\nQuestion:\nThe authors also used Illumina sequencing in this paper. What did they use it for? Why do you think they chose to do Illumina sequencing for these samples rather than PacBio?\nA: 30 x samples at low coverage for resequencing. A: cost, accuracy at SNP level.\n\nNote of caution: Batch variation. Are you doing all your samples in one batch, or will you have multiple batches? Technical variation can occur, so you may want to wait and do all samples at once on one larger flow cell, or make sure you randomise samples across sequencing batches.\n\n\n\n\n\nSequencing facilities:\n\nCurrent as of: December 2025\n\nNote: here we only mention instruments for NGS sequencing; some of these facilities also perform other non-NGS sequencing e.g., Sanger.\nOtago Genomics Facility (OGF)\nLocation: The University of Otago, Biochemistry Building.\n\nIllumina NextSeq 2000\n\nIllumina MiSeq\nONT P2 Solo\n\nONT MinION\n\nMassey Genome Service (MGS)\nLocation: Massey University,\n\n2 x Illumina MiSeq\n\nAuckland Genomics\nNon-service platforms around New Zealand:\n\nAgResearch (Invermay) have a NovaSeq - they will do it if have time and you ask nicely\n\nPacBio new at auckland\n\nLincoln have MGI - compatible with Illumina libraries.\n\n\n\nstuff on submission process, show example form ?",

Paired-end costs more, but gives you more resolution.\nThere are pros and cons to choosing either chemistry:\nTable 2: Single-end vs paired-end chemistry (short-read Illumina sequencing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemistry\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nSingle-end (SE)\nLower cost, fewer reads required (may be able to do more samples); sufficient for basic gene-level DGE\nLimited splice/isoform resolution; less confident mapping when mapping to a genome\n\n\nPaired-end (PE)\nBetter alignment; improved splice junction and isoform detection; more robust for complex transcriptomes or de novo transcriptome assembly\nHigher cost; ~2× sequencing required (two reads per fragment)\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, if you are doing short-read sequencing (i.e., Illumina), the sequencing facility will ask you what read length you want. You can typically chose from between 50bp-300bp (platform-dependent). The choice between a lower or higher read length will be a balance of cost (higher read length = higher cost) and the level of information you need (complex, novel or de novo transcriptomes require higher read lengths; more straight forward analyses with well-annotated genomes can utilise lower read lengths). In contrast, for long-read sequencing platforms (ONT and PacBio), you do not specify a fixed read length. Instead, reads are generated as single, continuous sequences, and their length is determined by the size of the input molecules, the library preparation method, and the sequencing chemistry.\nChoosing a read length is a trade-off between cost, and the amount of information you will recover:\nTable 3: Read length (short-read Illumina sequencing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead length\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\n50 bp\nLowest cost; highest sample multiplexing; sufficient for basic gene-level DGE in well-annotated genomes\nPoor isoform and splice junction resolution; higher multi-mapping\n\n\n100 bp\nGood balance of cost and information; reliable splice junction detection; widely used for standard RNA-seq\nSlightly lower throughput than 50 bp; may miss very complex isoforms\n\n\n150 bp\nImproved isoform resolution; better mapping across repetitive regions; useful for novel transcript discovery\nHigher cost; fewer reads per run\n\n\n300 bp\nMaximum per-read information; helpful for de novo transcriptome assembly\nRarely necessary for Illumina RNA-seq; expensive; reduced throughput\n\n\n\n\n\nExample RNAseq scenario:\nYou are working on a mouse model of cancer genomics. You want to do differential gene expression analysis to compare tumour samples to non-cancerous control tissue, to see if you can find genes that are up or down regulated in the cancerous tissue. You have 40 RNA samples, and since your species has a high-quality reference genome and annotation (i.e., mouse: Mus musculus), you know you have a “good” genome assembly and annotations to map your sequencing data back to (more on “good” genomes later!). The mouse genome is ~2.7 Gb (= 2,700,000,000 bp), diploid, with ~20,000 protein-coding genes.\nYou are particularly interested in alternative splicing and novel splice junctions, as you suspect that cancer-associated genes are often regulated at the isoform level.\nYou will sequence your samples at the Otago Genomics Facility, and see on their website they have an Illumina MiSeq and an Illumina NextSeq 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich platform will you chose?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Illumina NextSeq 2000 is a ‘medium’ sized short read sequencing platform, ideal for standard RNAseq, and is well-suited to this project. It can output up to 540Gb.\nThe Illumina MiSeq is a ‘small’ sized short read sequencing platform, better suited to QC or amplicon sequencing, and can output up to 30Gb. It is too small for this project.\nIllumina benchtop sequencing platforms comparison\n\n\n\nNext you need to decide how many reads you need.\nBased on table 1 above, how many reads do you need per sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReads per sample choice:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou decide you need 30 million reads per sample. You pick the lower end of the scale, as you suspect the genes you are most interested in will be highly expressed, and don’t expect your tissue to have a particular high transcript diversity that would require more reads.\nYou work out what minimum output you need from the flow cell:\n30 mil reads * 40 samples = 1200 million reads (1.2B).\n\n\n\nNow you need to decide if you want paired-end or single end reads.\nBased on table 2 above, what would you pick?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired-end vs single end choice:\n\n\n\n\n\nPaired-end sequencing will give better detection of novel isoforms and splice junctions\nThis doubles the number of reads generated per fragment and will give you better resolution.\n\n\n\nYou now need to decide which read length you need. Given the mouse genome is well-annotated, but you are looking for potentially novel isoforms, which read length would you pick, based on table 3?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead length choice:\n\n\n\n\n\n50 bp would be a good choice for a well-annotated genome like mouse for standard RNAseq, but does not suit this experiment, as you are looking for novel isoforms/alternative splicing.\n100bp is probably the best choice, balancing cost with novel isoform discovery.\nYou could also chose 150bp, if you want to be sure you’d capture novel isoforms, especially if they are quite long or complex genes - and don’t mind a higher cost.\n\n\n\nYou are now ready to pick your flow cell. Check out the Illumina NextSeq2000 flow cell specifications and chose which flow cell will suit this project best. There are four flow cells in ascending output size you can choose from: P1, P2, P3 and P4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich flow cell will you pick?\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on paired end sequencing using 100bp read length (i.e., 2 x 100bp):\nTotal reads needed for your experiment: 1.2 billion reads.\nCalculation: 1.2 billion reads x 100 (bp) x 2 (PE) = 240 Gb (240 gigabase pairs, or 240 billion individual DNA bases sequenced).\n\nP1 → No 100bp option and way too low\n\nP2 → 80 Gb (too low for 1.2B demand)\n\nP3 → 240 Gb (fits 1.2B reads requirement exactly)\n\nP4 → 360 Gb (oversized for this project)\n\nNote: the maximum output stated for the flow cell is under optimal conditions, so the P3 flow cell choice just fits, but it is possible you will have less reads then anticipated (e.g., instead of 30 mil reads per sample, you may get 28 mil per sample).\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You are now ready to sequence your RNAseq samples.\n \nFor Genome sequencing you will need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenome size\nExample species\nApprox genome size\nApprox reads per sample\n\n\n\n\nTiny\nVirus\n&lt;0.1 Mb\n0.1–0.5 million\n\n\nSmall\nBacteria\n5 Mb\n5–10 million\n\n\nMedium\nYeast\n12 Mb\n10–20 million\n\n\nLarge\nFruit fly (D. melanogaster)\n175 Mb\n50–100 million\n\n\nVery Large\nHuman\n3 Gb\n600–1,200 million\n\n\nHuge\nWheat\n16 Gb\n6–12 billion\n\n\n\nWhere Mb = megabase pairs (i.e., 1 Mb = 1,000,000 bp)\n\n\nExample DNAseq scenario:\nYou are want to de novo assemble the genome of the New Zealand swamp maire (Syzygium maire), a critically-endangered, endemic myrtaceae species, which is under threat from the pathogen myrtle rust.\nBased on genome sizes of related Syzygium and Myrtaceae species (e.g., Syzygium aromaticum ~370 Mb, S. grande ~405 Mb), you expect the S. maire genome to be on the order of ~350–400 Mb.\nDe novo genome assembly requires long read sequencing to resolve the longest contiguous sequences possible (ideally the full chromosome length, but that is often not easy to achieve!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich long-read sequencing platform should you chose?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two long-read platforms – PacBio and ONT. PacBio better for larger genomes than ONT? Ask someone who knows this to fill in.\n\n\n\ncoverage. talking about average coverage - really repetitive regions can have very low covergae, other more easily resolved sections will have higher coverage.\nheterozygosity homozygosity.\nBalkwill et al. 2024. Tree Genetics & Genomes.\nQuestion:\nThe authors also used Illumina sequencing in this paper. What did they use it for? Why do you think they chose to do Illumina sequencing for these samples rather than PacBio?\nA: 30 x samples at low coverage for resequencing. A: cost, accuracy at SNP level.\n\nNote of caution: Batch variation. Are you doing all your samples in one batch, or will you have multiple batches? Technical variation can occur, so you may want to wait and do all samples at once on one larger flow cell, or make sure you randomise samples across sequencing batches.",

    "text": "Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. It not only sets you up well for an analysis, but it also makes it easier to come back to the project later and share with collaborators, including your most important collaborator - future you.\nOrganising a project that includes sequencing involves many components. There’s the experimental setup and conditions metadata, measurements of experimental parameters, sequencing preparation and sample information, the sequences themselves and the files and workflow of any bioinformatics analysis. So much of the information of a sequencing project is digital, and we need to keep track of our digital records in the same way we have a lab notebook and sample freezer. In this lesson, we’ll go through the project organisation and documentation that will make an efficient bioinformatics workflow possible. Not only will this make you a more effective bioinformatics researcher, it also prepares your data and project for publication, as grant agencies and publishers increasingly require this information.\n\n\nWhen we think about the data for a sequencing project, we often start by thinking about the sequencing data that we get back from the sequencing centre. However, equally or more important is the data you’ve generated about the sequences before it ever goes to the sequencing centre. This is the data about the data, often called the metadata. Without the information about what you sequenced, the sequence data itself is useless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXERCISE 🧠🏋️‍♀️ - 3 mins\n\n\n\nWhat kind of data and information have you generated (or think you will generate) about your samples that can be considered metadata?

We often enter data in a way that makes it easy for us as humans to read and work with it, because we’re human! Computers need data structured in a way that they can use it. So to use this data in a computational workflow, we need to think like computers when we use spreadsheets.\nThe cardinal rules of using spreadsheet programs for data:\n\nLeave the raw data raw - do not change it!\n\nPut each observation or sample in its own row.\n\nPut all your variables in columns - the thing that vary between samples, like ‘strain’ or ‘DNA-concentration’.\n\nHave column names be explanatory, but without spaces. Use ‘-’, ’_’ or camel case instead of a space. For instance ‘library-prep-method’ or ‘LibraryPrep’is better than ’library preparation method’ or ‘prep’, because computers interpret spaces in particular ways.\n\nDo not combine multiple pieces of information in one cell. Sometimes it just seems like one thing, but think if that’s the only way you’ll want to be able to use or sort that data. For example, instead of having a column with species and strain name (e.g. E. coli K12) you would have one column with the species name (E. coli) and another with the strain name (K12). Depending on the type of analysis you want to do, you may even separate the genus and species names into distinct columns.\n\nExport the cleaned data to a text-based format like CSV (comma-separated values) format.
